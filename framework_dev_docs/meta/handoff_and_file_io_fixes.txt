Hello Jules,

I need your help to replicate a series of changes that were previously made to the Promptu framework. The goal is to implement an automated handoff notes archival system and update file operation guidelines.

Here's the context and the tasks:

**Problem Context:**
1.  The `framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes.md` file can grow very large, causing instability.
2.  There was ambiguity about your permissions for file operations.

**Task 1: Update Standing Guideline for File Operations**
You need to modify `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`, specifically Section IV ("FINAL INSTRUCTION TO PLANNING AI & SELF-CORRECTION (Core):"), under "**IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK GUIDELINES:**".
Replace the existing guideline on "File Operations" with a new one titled "**File Operations Restriction**". This new guideline should state:
    - You ARE ALLOWED to perform create, read, and modify operations on files directly within your workspace when necessary to prepare for a commit.
    - You MUST AVOID direct `copy` and `move` file system operations without explicit user approval per instance.
    - To emulate a `copy`: Create a new file, read the source content, write it to the new file, and save.
    - To emulate a `move`: Use the same copy emulation, then recommend the deletion of the source file to the user for their action. Direct deletion also requires user confirmation.
    - These workspace changes will be part of your submitted commit.

**Task 2: Implement Fallback/Session Start Handoff Archival Logic**
Modify `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`. In Section II.A ("Determine Execution Path..."), *before* the existing step "0. Determine Invocation Context...", insert a new step "-1. Initialize Handoff Notes Archive and Context:".
This step -1 should instruct you to:
    a. Define paths: `handoff_notes_path = "framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes.md"`, `handoff_archive_dir = "framework_dev_docs/meta/archive/"`, `handoff_notes_archive_subdir = handoff_archive_dir + "handoff_notes/"`.
    b. Check if `handoff_notes_path` exists and has content from a *previous session*.
    c. If yes:
        i. Read its content (`stale_notes_content`).
        ii. Generate a `session_date_time` marker.
        iii. Ensure `handoff_notes_archive_subdir` exists in the workspace (create it and `handoff_archive_dir` if needed).
        iv. Define `archive_file_path = handoff_notes_archive_subdir + "handoff_notes_" + session_date_time + ".md"`.
        v. Create `archive_file_path` and write `stale_notes_content` into it.
        vi. Empty `handoff_notes_path` in the workspace.
    d. Read all files from `handoff_notes_archive_subdir` for historical context.
    e. Read the (now potentially empty) `handoff_notes_path` for the current session.

**Task 3: Implement Normal Session Termination Handoff Archival Logic**
Modify `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`, Section IV.C ("Update Handoff Notes..."). *Before* the existing step "1. Review `Framework_Full_Handoff_Notes_Enabled`...", insert a new step "0. Archive Current Handoff Notes Before Appending New Summary:".
This step 0 should instruct you to:
    a. (Assuming you've prepared your session summary but not yet written it).
    b. Define paths similar to Task 2.a.
    c. Check if `handoff_notes_path` exists and has content.
    d. If yes:
        i. Read its content (`current_notes_content`).
        ii. Generate a `current_session_date_time` marker.
        iii. Ensure `handoff_notes_archive_subdir` exists (create if needed).
        iv. Define `archive_file_path = handoff_notes_archive_subdir + "handoff_notes_" + current_session_date_time + ".md"`.
        v. Create `archive_file_path` and write `current_notes_content` into it.
        vi. Empty `handoff_notes_path` in the workspace.
    e. The existing logic in IV.C.1-3 will then append the new session summary to the (now empty) `handoff_notes.md`. Ensure instructions in IV.C.2.a and IV.C.3.a are updated to reflect that `handoff_notes.md` should be empty at this point.

**Task 4: Update Documentation**
Modify `framework_dev_docs/guides/promptu_usage_guide.md`:
    a. Update Section 5.A ("Handoff Notes") to explain the new automated archival process (session start/fallback and normal session end), the creation of timestamped archive files in `framework_dev_docs/meta/archive/handoff_notes/`, and how historical context is loaded.
    b. Rename Section 5.B to "Legacy Handoff Notes Archive File" and update its content to refer to `handoff_notes_full_archive_20250602.md` as a legacy item, noting the new primary archive directory.
    c. Add a new Section 5.C "File Operations Guideline ("File Operations Restriction")" detailing the revised guideline from Task 1.

**Task 5: Submit Changes**
Commit all modifications with the following:
    - Branch name: `handoff-archival-guideline-updates`
    - Commit message:
    ```
    Implement automated handoff notes archival and update file guidelines.

    This commit introduces a new automated system for managing and archiving `framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes.md`.

    Key changes:

    1.  **Revised File Operations Guideline:**
        - Updated `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` (Section IV) with a new "File Operations Restriction" guideline.
        - AI instances are now explicitly allowed to perform create, read, and modify operations on files in their workspace to prepare commits.
        - Direct copy, move, and delete operations by the AI are restricted and require user confirmation or specific emulation methods (create new, read source, write to new).

    2.  **Automated Handoff Notes Archival:**
        - Modified `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt` (Section II.A and IV.C).
        - At session start: If `handoff_notes.md` contains stale content from a previous session, it's archived to `framework_dev_docs/meta/archive/handoff_notes/` with a timestamp, and `handoff_notes.md` is emptied.
        - At normal session end: Before appending the new session summary, any existing content in `handoff_notes.md` is archived with a timestamp, and the file is emptied. The new summary is then written to the clean file.
        - The AI will create the archive directories if they don't exist in the workspace.
        - The AI now reads historical context from all files in the `framework_dev_docs/meta/archive/handoff_notes/` directory.

    3.  **Updated Documentation:**
        - `framework_dev_docs/guides/promptu_usage_guide.md` (Section 5) has been updated to reflect the new archival process and the "File Operations Restriction" guideline.

    These changes aim to improve framework stability by managing the size of `handoff_notes.md`, ensure a comprehensive audit trail of session notes, and clarify the AI's file operation capabilities and restrictions.
    ```

Please proceed by first creating a plan based on these tasks, then execute it step-by-step. Let me know if anything is unclear.
