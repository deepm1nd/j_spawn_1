# HANDOFF NOTES for MPS Framework Development Task

This file is intended for use by Jules AI instances working on the iterative development and refinement of the Master Prompt Segment (MPS) framework. All canonical framework files are now located under `/prompts/` (for AI-usable content sources) and `/framework_dev_docs/` (for guides, examples, and meta-development files).

Each Jules instance concluding a work session on this task should append notes below, detailing:
- User feedback/requests addressed during its session.
- A summary of changes made to the MPS framework documents.
- The state in which deliverables were left (e.g., specific commits, branches).
- Any pending items or suggestions for the next Jules instance.

**Session Summary - [Date of this restructuring subtask]**
**Instance:** Jules (this instance)
**Key Actions:**
- Consolidated all MPS framework development from previous `/mps_01/`, `/mps_02/` and root `/prompts/util/` directories into the new canonical structure:
    - `/prompts/` for AI-usable source texts (MPS, Base IEP, Add-ons, Utilities).
    - `/framework_dev_docs/` for guides, examples, and meta-dev files.
- The canonical `prompts/Master_Prompt_Segment.md` now contains the v0.3.2 equivalent content (8 features: internal path & add-on config, dependency linking, effort estimation, risk assessment, knowledge capture, sanity checks, confidence score, visual overview).
- `prompts/iep/Base_IEP.txt` contains v0.2 content.
- All guides and examples updated to reflect new paths and MPS functionality.
- Old `/mps_01/` and `/mps_02/` directories will be deleted by this subtask.
**State of Deliverables:** All files prepared for a consolidated commit to a new branch (e.g., `feat/canonical-mps-framework-final`).
**Next Steps:** Commit this restructuring. Then, user will set up target repo for gritos test using these canonical files. Await gritos test results.

## MPS Performance Feedback Log

This section logs specific feedback on the performance, clarity, and effectiveness of the Master Prompt Segment (MPS) versions and the artifacts they help generate.

---
**Feedback Entry - [Date of this restructuring subtask]**
**Source of Feedback:** Initial setup of this feedback log section during MPS feature design.
**MPS Version Referenced:** Relevant for `prompts/Master_Prompt_Segment.md` (v0.3.2 and future versions).
**Context/Scenario:** Establishing the feedback mechanism as per design discussions for feature "Feedback Loop for MPS Refinement".
**Observation/Issue:** This log is intended to capture issues like:
    - Ambiguities in any version of `Master_Prompt_Segment.md` that lead to incorrect or suboptimal behavior by a Planning AI.
    - Problems encountered by Task AIs due to the structure or content of prompts generated based on an MPS version.
    - User difficulties in understanding or using the MPS, its generated `00_task_launch_plan.md`, or other artifacts.
    - Success stories where a particular MPS instruction proved very effective.
**Suggestion for MPS Refinement (if any):** N/A
