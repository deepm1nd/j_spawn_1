## MPS Performance Feedback Log

This section logs specific feedback on the performance, clarity, and effectiveness of the Master Prompt Segment (MPS) versions and the artifacts they help generate.

---
**Feedback Entry - [Date YYYY-MM-DD for when this section is first added by subtask]**
**Source of Feedback:** Initial setup of this feedback log section during MPS feature design.
**MPS Version Referenced:** Primarily relevant for `/mps_01/updated_Master_Prompt_Segment.txt` and future versions.
**Context/Scenario:** Establishing the feedback mechanism as per design discussions for feature "Feedback Loop for MPS Refinement".
**Observation/Issue:** This log is intended to capture issues like:
    - Ambiguities in any version of `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt` that lead to incorrect or suboptimal behavior by a Planning AI.
    - Problems encountered by Task AIs due to the structure or content of prompts generated based on an MPS version.
    - User difficulties in understanding or using the MPS, its generated `00_task_launch_plan.md`, or other artifacts.
    - Success stories where a particular MPS instruction proved very effective.
**Suggestion for MPS Refinement (if any):** N/A
