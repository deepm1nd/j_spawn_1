Hello Jules,

You are picking up an ongoing task to develop and iteratively refine a "Master Prompt Segment" (MPS) framework. This framework is designed to guide a "Planning AI" in generating structured project plans and task prompts for other AI instances. All canonical framework files are now located under `/prompts/` (for AI-usable content sources) and `/framework_dev_docs/` (for guides, examples, and meta-development files).

**Current Work Context:**
*   The primary canonical MPS is at `/prompts/Master_Prompt_Segment.md`.
*   Supporting canonical files like Base IEP content are in `/prompts/iep/`, add-on source texts in `/prompts/add_ons/`, etc.
*   Utility prompts (like pre-flight checks) are in `/prompts/util/`.
*   Framework development documentation (guides, examples, these meta notes) is under `/framework_dev_docs/`.
*   The `/framework_dev_docs/meta/HANDOFF_NOTES.md` contains a log of significant decisions, changes, and the state of work from previous Jules instances working on THIS MPS refinement task. **Crucially, it now also contains a section `## MPS Performance Feedback Log`. Your first steps should be to review BOTH the general handoff notes AND this specific feedback log thoroughly.**

**Your Immediate Task:**
1.  **Review `/framework_dev_docs/meta/HANDOFF_NOTES.md`, paying close attention to the `## MPS Performance Feedback Log` section.**
2.  Review the User's Latest Feedback/Request (provided immediately following this prompt).
3.  Understand the Current State based on `HANDOFF_NOTES.md` and current files in `/prompts/` and `/framework_dev_docs/`.
4.  Formulate a Plan to address the user's request. This plan should also include updating `/framework_dev_docs/meta/HANDOFF_NOTES.md` (both general notes and the feedback log if applicable).
5.  Seek User Approval for your plan.
6.  Execute and Iterate.

**Key Objectives for the MPS Framework (that you are helping to build):**
(List of 8 objectives remains the same)
1.  Highly effective at eliminating or mitigating merge conflicts.
2.  Easy for end-users and Task AIs to use.
3.  Highly parallelized where safe.
4.  Using readable file names.
5.  Enabling better progress tracking.
6.  Providing ways to communicate problems/requests between tasks.
7.  Open to other recommendations for improvements.
8.  Supportive of AI-automated PR creation.

**Before you finish your session:**
*   You **must** update the general section of `/framework_dev_docs/meta/HANDOFF_NOTES.md` with your session's work.
*   You **must also add a new, detailed entry to the `## MPS Performance Feedback Log` section** if applicable.
*   Ensure all your deliverables (changes to framework files) are committed.

The user is looking for your help to continue improving this MPS framework.
