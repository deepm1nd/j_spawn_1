# Example: Using the `promptimizer` Utility

This document provides an example of how the `promptimizer.txt` utility can be used to review and refine a high-level project request before it's submitted to a more detailed MPS (Master Prompt Segment) driven planning process.

## How to Use `promptimizer.txt`

The `promptimizer.txt` utility (located in `prompts/util/promptimizer/`) is designed to guide an AI (like Jules) in reviewing a user's initial project request. The typical workflow is:

1.  The user provides their high-level project request.
2.  An AI is invoked with its prompt starting with the full content of `prompts/util/promptimizer/promptimizer.txt`, followed immediately by the user's project request.
3.  The AI, following the instructions in `promptimizer.txt`, analyzes the request and provides structured feedback.
4.  The user can then use this feedback to refine their project request, making it clearer, more actionable, and better prepared for detailed MPS planning.

## Example User Project Request

I want to build a new mobile app. It should be really cool and use AI. The app will help people with their daily tasks and maybe have some social features. I think it should be on iOS and Android. I have some ideas for features like a smart calendar and a way to share updates with friends. Not sure about the database yet. Need this done quickly.

## Example AI Reviewer Feedback (Using `promptimizer.txt`)

Here's how an AI, guided by `promptimizer.txt`, might respond to the example project request above:

### Promptimizer Feedback on Your Project Request: "New Mobile App"

Thank you for submitting your project request! Here's some feedback based on the Promptimizer utility to help refine it for more detailed planning:

1.  **Overall Goal Clarity:**
    *   The primary objective is to "build a new mobile app," which is clear at a high level. However, "help people with their daily tasks" and "maybe have some social features" are a bit vague.
    *   **Suggestion:** Could you specify 2-3 key *types* of daily tasks the app will primarily focus on? For social features, what is the core interaction (e.g., sharing achievements, collaborative task lists, simple status updates)?

2.  **Scope Definition:**
    *   The request mentions iOS and Android, which helps define platform scope. "Need this done quickly" implies a desire for a potentially limited initial scope to meet a fast timeline.
    *   The scope of "daily tasks" and "social features" is very broad.
    *   **Suggestion:** To manage scope for a quick delivery, consider prioritizing a core set of features for a first version (Minimum Viable Product). What would be the absolute essential features?

3.  **Input Document Specification:**
    *   The request mentions "some ideas for features like a smart calendar."
    *   It's unclear if these ideas are documented anywhere (e.g., feature lists, user stories, design mockups).
    *   **Suggestion:** If you have any documents, sketches, or more detailed notes about these feature ideas, please list them or indicate where they can be found. If not, consider creating a short document outlining the "smart calendar" and other key feature concepts.

4.  **Primary Deliverable(s) Clarity:**
    *   The main deliverable is "a new mobile app" on iOS and Android.
    *   It might be helpful to also consider other potential deliverables, e.g., a basic design document, a user guide, or a deployment plan, depending on the project's needs.
    *   **Suggestion:** For the initial phase, are you expecting just the app itself, or also some planning/design documents to be generated by the next AI planning phase?

5.  **Suitability for MPS-driven Planning:**
    *   The request is at a good high level for an MPS-driven Planning AI to break it down. It's not too granular.
    *   However, adding a bit more detail as suggested above (core tasks, key social interaction) will provide more substance for the Planning AI to create meaningful phases and tasks.
    *   **Suggestion:** No major changes needed here, but the clarifications above will improve its suitability.

6.  **Actionability & Potential Ambiguities:**
    *   "Really cool and use AI": This is subjective and not very actionable for a Planning AI. What specific aspects should be "cool"? What kind of "AI" capabilities are envisioned (e.g., predictive text, recommendation engine, natural language understanding for task input)?
    *   "Not sure about the database yet": This is a technical detail that will need to be addressed during planning or design. It's good to note, but the Planning AI will likely flag this for a decision-making task.
    *   "Need this done quickly": This is a constraint. It would be helpful to quantify "quickly" if possible (e.g., "initial version in 3 months," "MVP in 6 weeks").
    *   **Suggestion:** Try to define "AI" features more concretely. For "quickly," if you have a target timeframe, even a rough one, it would be useful.

7.  **Explicit Request for Phased/Multi-Task Approach (Observation):**
    *   The request does not explicitly ask for a phased approach, but its nature (building a new app) implies it. The MPS framework will enforce a phased breakdown.

**Overall:** This is a good starting point! Adding a bit more specificity to the core features, target user benefits, and any known constraints will greatly help the subsequent MPS planning phase.
