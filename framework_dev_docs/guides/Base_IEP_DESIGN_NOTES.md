This document provides context and design rationale for the Base Information Exchange Protocol (Base IEP). The canonical *content* of the Base IEP (for AI use by copying to target repo) is stored in `/prompts/iep/Base_IEP.txt` in this framework development repository.

## 1. Purpose and Philosophy
(Content from existing Base_IEP_Definition.md - section 1)

## 2. Core Base IEP Fields
(Content from existing Base_IEP_Definition.md - section 2, explaining the fields)

## 3. Extensibility Mechanism
(Content from existing Base_IEP_Definition.md - section 3, explaining how Notes-To-Next-Jules is used with tags, provide example)

## 4. Responsibilities
