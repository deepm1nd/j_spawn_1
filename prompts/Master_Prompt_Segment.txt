[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]
# Instructions for user:
# - List desired add-on "app names" (folder names) below, one per line.
# - Mark selection with '[x]' (case-insensitive for 'x').
# - Add-on apps must exist as subdirectories in `prompts/add_ons/` in the target repository.
# - Each add-on app folder must contain a primary instruction file: `[app_name]/[app_name].txt`.
#
# - If a primary add-on like 'task_spawning_addon' is selected, other selected add-on apps
#   listed *before* it will typically have their primary instruction file content appended to the
#   generated task prompts, preserving their listed order. This allows you to control the
#   sequence of supplementary instructions in task prompts.
#
# - If no primary add-on app that generates sub-tasks is selected (or if 'task_spawning_addon'
#   is not selected), other selected add-on apps will be processed as per their own directives,
#   and their order of execution by the Planning AI will also follow this list.
#
# - App-specific configurations: Some add-on apps may use parameters defined in a
#   `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_appName]]...[[END_USER_CONFIG_FOR_appName]]` block, which you would
#   place in your main spawn prompt (typically after your project request and before the
#   `[[MASTER_PROMPT_SEGMENT]]` block). Refer to the add-on's documentation or its
#   `USER_appName_CONFIG.txt` template file for details on its parameters.

[x] task_resumption_addon               # Example: Provides task state resumption capabilities for Task AIs.
# [ ] example_coding_standards_addon    # Example: Could provide coding standards for Task AIs.
# [ ] example_security_checklist_addon  # Example: Could provide security checks for Task AIs.
#
# [ ] build_product_specs_process # Example: Select to generate product specification documents.
# [ ] task_spawning_addon  # CRITICAL: Select this to enable project planning & task generation by the Planning AI.
                               # If selected, it's generally best listed last as it orchestrates other add-ons for Task AIs.

[[START OF MASTER PROMPT SEGMENT (v0.4.0 - App-Specific Configs, Fixed Component Paths): AI Project Planning & Task Generation Instructions]]

# Overall AI Operation:
# You are a Planning AI. Your primary function is to interpret a user's project request (provided by the user *before* this Master Prompt Segment begins)
# and then to follow the instructions within this segment, including processing selected add-on "apps", to achieve the user's goal.
# This MPS now uses a "folder-per-app" architecture for components (add-ons, utils) with fixed base paths (e.g., `prompts/add_ons/`, `prompts/util/`).
# App-specific configurations can be provided by the user in their main spawn prompt within `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_appName]]...[[END_USER_CONFIG_FOR_appName]]` blocks.
# Core operational instructions, including component discovery and loading, are defined in an included file.

[[INCLUDE Core_Planning_Instructions.txt FROM /prompts/iep/Core_Planning_Instructions.txt]]

# Note: The `Core_Planning_Instructions.txt` will guide you on parsing `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]`,
# discovering app-specific config blocks from the main prompt, loading components, and executing the
# selected primary add-on app or other selected add-ons.
