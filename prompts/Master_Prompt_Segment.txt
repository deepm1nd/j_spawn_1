[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]
# Instructions for User: Edit the paths below before using this MPS.
# - Main Iteration Folder: Where the Planning AI will place all its outputs for the target project.
#   Use '.' for the repository root, or a relative path like 'project_X_outputs'.
# - Prompts Folder: Subdirectory for generated task prompts, TLP, IEP. Relative to Main Iteration Folder.
#   Example: 'prompts/tasks' if Main Iteration Folder is '.'.
# - Submodule Plan Destination: Directory for main project plan (e.g., gritos_dev_plan.md) and Task AI _dev_plan.md files. Relative to Main Iteration Folder.
# - Inter-AI Communication Folder: Subdirectory for IPC files. Typically nested within 'Prompts Folder'.
# - User-Specified Task Output Base Path: The root path where Task AIs will place their primary deliverables (e.g., code). Relative to repo root.

Main Iteration Folder: .
Prompts Folder: prompts/tasks
Submodule Plan Destination: plan
Inter-AI Communication Folder: prompts/tasks/ipc
User-Specified Task Output Base Path: dev/default_task_outputs

[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]
# Instructions for user:
# - List desired add-on filenames below, one per line.
# - Mark selection with '[x]' (case-insensitive for 'x').
# - Add-ons must exist in the '/prompts/add_ons/' directory of this repository (i.e., the repo where the Planning AI runs).
# - Ensure exact filenames, including extensions (e.g., .txt).
#
# - If 'task_spawning_addon.txt' (see below) is selected, other selected add-ons listed *before* it
#   will typically be appended to the generated task prompts, preserving their listed order.
#   This allows you to control the sequence of supplementary instructions in task prompts.
#
# - If 'task_spawning_addon.txt' is NOT selected, other add-ons will be processed as per
#   their own directives, and their order of execution by the Planning AI will also follow this list.

[x] task_resumption_addon.txt               # Example: Provides task state resumption capabilities for Task AIs.
# [ ] example_coding_standards_addon.txt    # Example: Could provide coding standards for Task AIs.
# [ ] example_security_checklist_addon.txt  # Example: Could provide security checks for Task AIs.
#
# [ ] task_spawning_addon.txt  # CRITICAL: Select this to enable project planning & task generation by the Planning AI.
                               # If selected, it's generally best listed last as it orchestrates the use of other add-ons for Task AIs.
