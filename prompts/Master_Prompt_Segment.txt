[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]
# Instructions for User: Edit the paths below before using this MPS.

# --- General Project & Task Spawning Paths (used by task_spawning_addon.txt and other general purpose add-ons) ---
# - Main Iteration Folder: Where the Planning AI will place all its outputs for the target project.
#   Use '.' for the repository root, or a relative path like 'project_X_outputs'.
# - Prompts Folder: Subdirectory for generated task prompts, TLP, IEP. Relative to Main Iteration Folder.
#   Example: 'prompts/tasks' if Main Iteration Folder is '.'.
# - Submodule Plan Destination: Directory for main project plan (e.g., gritos_dev_plan.md) and Task AI _dev_plan.md files. Relative to Main Iteration Folder.
# - Inter-AI Communication Folder: Subdirectory for IPC files. Typically nested within 'Prompts Folder'.
# - User-Specified Task Output Base Path: The root path where Task AIs will place their primary deliverables (e.g., code). Relative to repo root.

Main Iteration Folder: .
Prompts Folder: prompts/tasks
Submodule Plan Destination: plan
Inter-AI Communication Folder: prompts/tasks/ipc
User-Specified Task Output Base Path: dev/default_task_outputs

# --- Variables for "Build Product Specs" Process (used by build_product_specs_process.txt add-on) ---
# PRODUCT_NAME: Your_Product_Name_Here                 # e.g., "NovaSystem", "QuantumLeap CRM". Used for naming output files.
# PRODUCT_SPECS_INPUT_DOCS_PATH: product_dev/inputs   # Relative to repo root. Folder containing market research, user feedback, competitive analysis, etc.
# PRODUCT_SPECS_GUIDANCE_DOCS_PATH: product_dev/guidance # Relative to repo root. Folder containing branding guides, compliance docs, technical constraints, style guides.
# PRODUCT_SPECS_OUTPUT_PATH: product_dev/specifications # Relative to repo root. Folder where generated specification documents (e.g., PRD, MRD, technical specs) will be saved.
# PRODUCT_SPECS_PRIMARY_INPUT_FILE: product_dev/inputs/main_requirements_document.md # Optional: Specific document (path relative to repo root) to guide heading-based research.
# PRODUCT_SPECS_REF_DEPTH: 1 # Optional: Depth for following internal references within provided documents (0, 1, or 2). Default is 1 if not specified.
# PRODUCT_SPECS_CODEBASE_REVIEW_PREFERENCE: cursory # Optional: "complex", "cursory", or "focused". Default: "cursory". Controls AI's depth when reviewing linked codebases/files.
# PRODUCT_SPECS_CODEBASE_FOCUS_AREAS: "" # Optional: Comma-separated keywords or phrases if preference is "focused", to guide AI's attention within code. (e.g., "authentication, API integration, data validation")

[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]
# Instructions for user:
# - List desired add-on filenames below, one per line.
# - Mark selection with '[x]' (case-insensitive for 'x').
# - Add-ons must exist in the '/prompts/add_ons/' directory of this repository (i.e., the repo where the Planning AI runs).
# - Ensure exact filenames, including extensions (e.g., .txt).
#
# - If 'task_spawning_addon.txt' (see below) is selected, other selected add-ons listed *before* it
#   will typically be appended to the generated task prompts, preserving their listed order.
#   This allows you to control the sequence of supplementary instructions in task prompts.
#
# - If 'task_spawning_addon.txt' is NOT selected, other add-ons will be processed as per
#   their own directives, and their order of execution by the Planning AI will also follow this list.

[x] task_resumption_addon.txt               # Example: Provides task state resumption capabilities for Task AIs.
# [ ] example_coding_standards_addon.txt    # Example: Could provide coding standards for Task AIs.
# [ ] example_security_checklist_addon.txt  # Example: Could provide security checks for Task AIs.
#
# [ ] build_product_specs_process.txt # Example: Select to generate product specification documents.
# [ ] task_spawning_addon.txt  # CRITICAL: Select this to enable project planning & task generation by the Planning AI.
                               # If selected, it's generally best listed last as it orchestrates the use of other add-ons for Task AIs.
