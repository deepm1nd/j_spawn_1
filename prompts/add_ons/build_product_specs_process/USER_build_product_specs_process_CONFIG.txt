[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_build_product_specs_process]]
# This block contains user-configurable parameters for the 'build_product_specs_process' add-on.
# When this add-on is selected by the user in `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]`:
# 1. The framework will first look for this entire block (delimiters included) in the main user spawn prompt.
# 2. If found, that version is used by the add-on.
# 3. If not found in the main prompt, the add-on will refer to this file for defaults and current settings.
# 4. If a parameter is 'Required' and its 'DefaultType' is 'PlaceholderDefault', and its value
#    is still a placeholder after checking the main prompt and this file's current value,
#    the AI (Jules) will request the value from the user via chat and then update THIS FILE.
#    It will also output the complete, updated block for the user to copy into their main spawn prompt.
