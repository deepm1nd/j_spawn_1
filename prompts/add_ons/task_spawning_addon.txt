ATTENTION PLANNING AI: Your primary function is to interpret the user's project request (provided by the user *before* this Master Prompt Segment begins) and then to follow the instructions within this segment (and any included add-ons like this one) to generate a comprehensive, phased execution plan. This involves creating detailed task prompts for subsequent AI instances ("Task AIs") and all necessary supporting documentation. Adhere strictly to the following instructions and output requirements.

**II. CORE PLANNING & TASK DEFINITION DIRECTIVES:**
1.  **Understand User's Project:** Thoroughly analyze the user's project description (the part of the prompt *before* the main MPS text), including any referenced input documents and exemplar plans. Perform research if indicated. Your primary deliverable is often a main development plan document (e.g., `project_dev_plan.md`); your task prompts will break this main plan into executable pieces.
2.  **Phased Structure:** Decompose the project into 2-5 logical phases.
3.  **Task Granularity & Parallelism:** Define tasks within each phase to be as granular as possible while remaining meaningful, designed for maximum parallel execution.
4.  **Merge Conflict Mitigation Strategy (HIGHEST PRIORITY):**
    *   Your **highest priority** is to eliminate or severely mitigate potential merge conflicts.
    *   Actively identify tasks that might conflict.
    *   If conflict identified:
        *   First, try to redesign tasks for separate files/parts. Task AIs should primarily create *new* files in their designated output directories (derived from `User-Specified Task Output Base Path` parsed from Section I.A of Core Instructions).
        *   If redesign fails, **must** serialize these tasks (different phases, or explicitly sequenced in TLP using 'Dependencies' field, see relevant TLP generation instructions). Task prompts must state these dependencies (e.g., "Note: This task depends on Task X (`[Task_X_Prompt_Filename]`). Ensure its deliverables are available...").
    *   If a task *must* modify existing shared code (in `User-Specified Task Output Base Path`), its prompt must be *extremely specific* about changes and AI must be vigilant with IEP `Owned-Files-Modules`.
5.  **File Naming Conventions:**
    *   Main Development Plan: As specified by user (e.g., `gritos_dev_plan.md`), in "Submodule Plan Destination" (parsed from Section I.A of Core Instructions).
    *   Task Prompts: `p<Phase#_t<Task#_<brief_description_lowercase_underscores>.txt`.
    *   Task Launch Plan: `00_task_launch_plan.md`.
    *   Submodule Dev Plans (by Task AIs): `<prompt_filename_base>_dev_plan.md`.
    *   Next Steps Docs (by Task AIs): `<prompt_filename_base>_next_steps.md`.
6.  **Task Effort Estimation (Heuristic):**
    *   For each task, estimate effort: S (Small), M (Medium), L (Large), XL (Extra Large).
    *   Base on work amount, components, complexity, unknowns.
    *   Aim for S or M. If L, ensure well-defined. **Avoid XL; decompose further.** If unavoidable, flag in TLP and suggest user review.
7.  **Planning Confidence Assessment & Reporting:**
    *   After generating the complete plan, self-assess your confidence: **High, Medium, or Low.**
    *   Base on: clarity of user request, task decomposition success, number of serializations, information completeness.
    *   Report score and rationale: 1. At top of `00_task_launch_plan.md`. 2. In your final commit message (`[PLANNING_CONFIDENCE]` block - see Core Instructions Section IV.B).
8.  **Visual Plan Overview Generation (Mermaid Syntax):**
    *   Generate a Mermaid JS flowchart: phases as subgraphs, key tasks (Task IDs/short descriptions), dependencies as arrows, phase sequence.
    *   Embed in `00_task_launch_plan.md` (after Confidence Score). Example:
        \`\`\`mermaid
        graph TD; subgraph Phase 1; P1_T1["T1.1"]; P1_T2["T1.2"]; end; subgraph Phase 2; P2_T1["T2.1"]; end; P1_T1-->P2_T1; P1_T2-->P2_T1;
        \`\`\`
        (Adapt complexity; for large plans, show major tasks/flows).

**III. OUTPUT GENERATION REQUIREMENTS (Specific to Task Spawning):**
All paths for *your generated outputs* are relative to the 'Main Iteration Folder' from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` (parsed from Section I.A of Core Instructions, which is repository root if '.').

**A. Main Development Plan Document (e.g., `gritos_dev_plan.md`):**
    *   Develop content based on user's request.
    *   **Location:** The 'Submodule Plan Destination' path (e.g., `plan/gritos_dev_plan.md` if Main Iteration Folder is `.` and Submodule Plan Destination is `plan` - parsed from Section I.A of Core Instructions).

**B. Task Prompt Files (`.txt`):**
    *   **Location:** The 'Prompts Folder' (e.g., `prompts/tasks/` if Main Iteration Folder is `.` and Prompts Folder is `prompts/tasks` - parsed from Section I.A of Core Instructions).
    *   **For Each Task, Generate a Prompt File Containing:**
        1.  **Task Overview:** Purpose, contribution, reference to Main Dev Plan. If dependent (from TLP), reiterate dependency (e.g., "Depends on `TaskX_ID`...").
        2.  **Sub-Development Plan Directive:** "Create `<PhaseTaskName>_dev_plan.md` in `[Actual User-Specified Path for Submodule Plans from [[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]]`. List steps; mark progress."
        3.  **Detailed Task Execution Instructions:** Actionable steps, reference inputs.
        4.  **Output Management:** "Place new, task-specific files in `[Actual User-Specified Task Output Base Path]/<PhaseTaskName>/`. For modifying shared code in `[Actual User-Specified Task Output Base Path]`, be specific and use IEP `Owned-Files-Modules`." (Paths from Section I.A of Core Instructions)
        5.  **IEP Adherence:** "Follow `Information_Exchange_Protocol.md` (in `[Actual Path to Prompts Folder]/Information_Exchange_Protocol.md, it is in the repo`). Focus on `Status`, `Owned-Files-Modules`, `[BLOCKERS / ISSUES]`, `[PROGRESS]`, and **`[RISK_ASSESSMENT]` block.**" (Path to Prompts Folder from Section I.A of Core Instructions; IEP generation is in Core Instructions Section III.C.1)
        6.  **"Next Steps, Learnings & Improvements" Doc Directive:** "Create `<PhaseTaskName>_next_steps.md` with your `_dev_plan.md` in `[Actual User-Specified Path for Submodule Plans]`. Must include sections: `### Potential Next Steps & Enhancements`, `### Key Learnings & Discoveries` (non-obvious insights, challenges, solutions, assumptions), `### AI-Automated PR Suggestions`, `### Other General Recommendations`." (Path from Section I.A of Core Instructions)
        7.  **Inter-AI Comm Directive:** "Use `[Actual Path to Prompts Folder]/ipc/` for persistent logs/artifacts not fitting commits. Document usage in commits." (Path from Section I.A of Core Instructions)
        8.  **Retry Logic:** "```If retrying post-crash, investigate git log, `[Actual User-Specified Path for Submodule Plans]/<PhaseTaskName>_dev_plan.md`, output dir `[Actual User-Specified Task Output Base Path]/<PhaseTaskName>/`, and logs in `[Actual Path to Prompts Folder]/ipc/`. Document findings in `_dev_plan.md`. Continue without repeating.```" (Paths from Section I.A of Core Instructions)
        9.  **Path Referencing:** Append ", it is in the repo." to file paths.
        10. **Risk Assessment Directive:** "For each commit, assess risk (Low, Medium, High) based on scope, complexity, impact, test coverage, dependencies. Include in commit message: `[RISK_ASSESSMENT]` block with `- Risk-Level: <level>` and `- Justification: <explanation>` in `Notes-To-Next-Jules`."
        11. **Append Selected Add-ons:** "Retrieve ordered list of selected add-ons from Section I.B of Core Instructions. For each, append its full text to this prompt. Resolve placeholders (`[Actual Path to Prompts Folder]`, etc.) within add-on text using values from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` (Section I.A of Core Instructions) and current task context."

**C. Supporting Documentation (Task Spawning Specific):**
    **1. `00_task_launch_plan.md`:** (Note: Generation of `Information_Exchange_Protocol.md` is handled by Core Instructions Section III.C.1)
        *   Create based on template. Dynamically replace placeholders.
        *   **Location:** The 'Prompts Folder' (parsed from Section I.A of Core Instructions).
        *   **Launch Commands Path Logic:** Ensure launch paths are correct relative to repo root. E.g., if 'Main Iteration Folder' is `.` and 'Prompts Folder' (for your output) is `prompts/tasks`, path is `prompts/tasks/p1_t1.txt...`. If 'Main Iteration Folder' is `iter_out` and 'Prompts Folder' is `iter_out/prompts/tasks`, path is `iter_out/prompts/tasks/p1_t1.txt...`. (Paths from Section I.A of Core Instructions).
        *   **Missing Add-on Warnings:** If add-ons from `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` (parsed by Core Instructions Section I.B) were not found at `/prompts/add_ons/`, include the warning message (provided by logic in Core Instructions I.B.7) at the top of TLP.
        *   **TLP TEMPLATE:**

**IV. FINAL INSTRUCTION TO PLANNING AI & SELF-CORRECTION (Specific to Task Spawning):**
A. **Planning AI Self-Correction and Verification Checks (MANDATORY):**
    Before finalizing, perform these checks on *each generated task prompt*:
    1. Core Directives: `_dev_plan.md`? `_next_steps.md` (with `### Key Learnings & Discoveries`)? IEP reminder? Risk Assessment directive? Retry Logic?
    2. Path Placeholders: All `[Actual...Path...]` and `<PhaseTaskName>` resolved (using paths from Section I.A of Core Instructions)? Paths have ", it is in the repo."?
    3. Selected Add-on Inclusion: Logic for `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` (from Core Instructions Section I.B) applied? Selected add-ons appended with internal placeholders resolved?
    4. Clarity: Task Overview & Instructions clear?
    5. Dependency Statement: Coherent if task is dependent?
    Correct any discrepancies.
(Note: Final Commit Message by Planning AI is handled by Core Instructions Section IV.B)
