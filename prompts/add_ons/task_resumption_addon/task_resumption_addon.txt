[[START OF 'TASK_RESUMPTION_ADDON' v0.1: Instructions for AI Task Management]]

**Purpose:** This add-on instructs the AI (Jules) to generate a detailed "Resumption Prompt" for the current task it is working on. This allows the current task to be paused and resumed efficiently by another AI instance (or the same AI at a later time) with minimal context loss.

**Instructions for AI (Jules) executing the main task this add-on is appended to:**

1.  **Identify Core Task Details:**
    *   Review your original prompt for this task (the prompt this add-on is attached to). Identify and summarize:
        *   The overall goal of this task.
        *   The specific deliverables requested by the original task prompt.
    *   Review your `dev_plan.md` for this task. Note the last completed step and the next planned step(s).

2.  **Summarize Work Completed:**
    *   Consult your commit history for this task (as per the Base IEP rules, found in `/promptu/core/base_iep.txt`).
    *   List the key actions you have taken and the files you have created or modified for this task. Reference specific commit IDs where appropriate.

3.  **Determine Output Location for Resumption Prompt:**
    *   The Resumption Prompt file you will create must be saved in the folder specified by the Planning AI as the 'Submodule Plan Destination' (this is where your `dev_plan.md` and `next_steps.md` for this task should also reside).
    *   The filename for the Resumption Prompt must be: `<ExactOriginalTaskPromptFilenameBase>_resumption_prompt.txt`. (e.g., if your original task prompt filename was `p1_t1_some_task.txt`, this file will be `p1_t1_some_task_resumption_prompt.txt`).

4.  **Generate the Resumption Prompt Content:**
    Create the content for your `<ExactOriginalTaskPromptFilenameBase>_resumption_prompt.txt` file with the following structure:

    \`\`\`text
    # Resumption Prompt for Task: [Original Task Name/Objective from your main task prompt]

    ## Original Task Goal:
    [Your summary of the overall goal from your main task prompt]

    ## Original Task Deliverables:
    [Your list of specific deliverables from your main task prompt]

    ## Current Task State (as of [Current Timestamp]):

    ### Last Completed Step (from your `dev_plan.md`):
    [Quote the last completed step from your `dev_plan.md`]

    ### Next Planned Step(s) (from your `dev_plan.md`):
    [Quote the next planned step or steps from your `dev_plan.md`]

    ### Summary of Work Done So Far (for this task):
    [Your bulleted list of key actions and files created/modified, with commit references if available. e.g.,
    - Created initial project structure (Commit: XXXXXX)
    - Implemented function Y in file Z.py (Commit: YYYYYY)
    - Encountered issue: [brief description of issue if any is blocking your next step]
    ]

    ## Files Created/Modified in this Session (relative to project root, primarily within `[Actual User-Specified Task Output Base Path]/<YourPhaseTaskName>/`):
    [Your list of file paths created or modified during your work session for this task. Ensure paths are clear and relative to the project root.]

    ## Next Steps for Resuming AI:
    1.  Review the above context thoroughly.
    2.  Focus on completing: "[Next Planned Step(s) from your `dev_plan.md`]"
    3.  Ensure all original task deliverables (from your main task prompt) are met.
    4.  Continue to update your `dev_plan.md` and follow the Base IEP rules (from `/promptu/core/base_iep.txt`) for commits.
    5.  If any blocking issues were noted above, address them first.

    ## Original Full Prompt for this Task (for reference):
    [[[
    [You must paste the ENTIRE original prompt content for THIS TASK here. Ensure it's clearly demarcated to avoid confusion with this resumption prompt's own instructions.]
    ]]]
    \`\`\`

5.  **Save the Resumption Prompt:**
    *   Write the content generated in Step 4 to your `<ExactOriginalTaskPromptFilenameBase>_resumption_prompt.txt` file at the location determined in Step 3.

6.  **Update Your Commit Message (Base IEP Extension):**
    *   When you commit the creation or any update of this `_resumption_prompt.txt`, you **must** extend your commit message as per the Base IEP.
    *   In the `Notes-To-Next-Jules:` field of your commit message for *this task*, add the following structured tag:
        `[TASK_RESUMPTION_PROMPT_STATUS]: Updated_At='[Actual Path to Submodule Plan Destination]/<ExactOriginalTaskPromptFilenameBase>_resumption_prompt.txt'`
        (Ensure you use the correct, full path as resolved from the Planning AI's instructions).

7.  **Initial Creation Timing:**
    *   You should create the *initial version* of this resumption prompt *before* you begin the primary execution steps of your main task, typically after you have created your initial `dev_plan.md`. Update it after each significant step or commit.

These instructions are critical for enabling efficient, stateful task handoff. Adhere to them precisely.
