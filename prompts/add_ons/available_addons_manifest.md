# Available Prompt Add-ons

To use an add-on, include its **app name (which is its folder name)** in the `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` block of your `post_promptu.txt` file. Add-on "apps" are subdirectories located within the `promptu/add_ons/` directory. The Planning AI, guided by `core_planning_instructions.txt`, will then read the primary instruction file for a selected add-on from `promptu/add_ons/[addon_app_name]/[addon_app_name].txt`. Each add-on app folder may also contain other supporting files or sub-frameworks for that specific add-on.

- **`task_resumption_addon`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Inheritable Utility
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `task_resumption_addon/task_resumption_addon.txt`) instructs Task AIs to create and maintain a resumable prompt for their current task. This helps in continuing work seamlessly if a task is interrupted.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Typically appended to task prompts generated by a primary orchestration add-on (like `task_spawning_addon`) to enhance Task AI robustness.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be inherited by Task AIs.

- **`task_spawning_addon`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Primary Orchestration Add-on
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `task_spawning_addon/task_spawning_addon.txt`) enables the core project planning and task generation functionality. When selected, the Planning AI will generate a main development plan, a Task Launch Plan (`00_task_launch_plan.md`), and individual task prompt files for subsequent Task AIs. It is now configurable via its `user_task_spawning_addon_config.txt` file (located in `promptu/add_ons/task_spawning_addon/`) and its parameters can be overridden by a `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_task_spawning_addon]]` block in the user's `post_promptu.txt` file.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Essential for using the Promptu framework to break down a user's project request into a structured, phased plan with detailed, executable tasks. This is the primary add-on for project decomposition and multi-task coordination.
    - **Key Parameters (defined in `user_task_spawning_addon_config.txt`):**
        - `PROJECT_NAME` (Optional): Name of the overall project, used for context or default naming.
        - `ITERATION_ID` (Optional): Identifier for the current iteration or run.
        - `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH` (Required): User-defined base directory for all outputs from this add-on.
        - `MAIN_DEV_PLAN_FILENAME` (Required): Filename for the main plan document generated by this add-on (e.g., `main_development_plan.md`).
        - `TASK_PROMPTS_SUBDIR` (Required): Subdirectory (relative to `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`) for the Task Launch Plan and individual task prompt files.
        - `SUBMODULE_PLANS_SUBDIR` (Required): Subdirectory (relative to `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`) for `dev_plan.md` and `next_steps.md` files generated by Task AIs.
        - `TASK_ARTIFACTS_SUBDIR` (Required): Subdirectory (relative to `BASE_OUTPUT_PATH`) for the actual deliverables and new files created by Task AIs.
    - **Key Outputs:** `[MAIN_DEV_PLAN_FILENAME]`, `00_task_launch_plan.md`, multiple `p<Phase>_t<Task>_*.txt` task prompts. Output locations are determined by the resolved parameters.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Works in conjunction with `promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt`. Other selected add-on apps (like `task_resumption_addon`) will have their primary instruction file content appended to the task prompts generated by this add-on; the `task_spawning_addon` app's own primary instruction content is not appended.

- **`create_research_report`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Primary Process Add-on
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `create_research_report/create_research_report.txt`) guides the AI in generating a research report based on provided inputs. It involves parsing user configurations, ingesting and validating input documents and web links, performing research (including following references to a specified depth), iteratively generating content based on desired output depth, and finally assembling the report.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** To automate or assist in the creation of research reports. It can be used to synthesize information from various sources, follow research trails, and produce structured outputs from outlines to detailed reports with AI-generated insights.
    - **Key Inputs (from `user_create_research_report_config.txt` located in `promptu/add_ons/create_research_report/`):**
        - `PROPOSED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS` (Optional)
        - `GUIDELINES_DOC_PATHS` (Optional)
        - `ADDITIONAL_WEB_LINKS_FILE` (Optional)
        - `EXEMPLAR_DOCS` (Optional)
        - `GENERAL_INPUT_DOCS` (Required)
        - `PRIMARY_INPUT_DOC_PATH` (Required)
        - `ITERATIVE_OUTPUT_DEPTH` (Required, 0-3)
        - `REFERENCE_FOLLOWING_DEPTH` (Required, 0-2)
    - **Key Outputs:** Generic research reports. The specific names and structure will depend on the inputs and the execution of the add-on's logic. Output location is typically determined by its own configuration parameters or general path configurations if not overridden.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be used as a primary add-on. Relies on its specific `user_create_research_report_config.txt` file for configuration. If selected alongside other primary add-ons like `task_spawning_addon`, the user's overarching request in `post_promptu.txt` must clearly direct which process is primary.

- **`test_resolver_component`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Utility / Test Component
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `test_resolver_component/test_resolver_component.txt`) is a dummy component used for testing the component resolution mechanism, especially when a promptApp might provide an app-specific version.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** For framework testing. It prints a message indicating whether the global or an app-specific version was run, and displays the value of a dummy parameter.
    - **Key Inputs (from `user_test_resolver_component_config.txt` located in `promptu/add_ons/test_resolver_component/`):**
        - `DUMMY_PARAM` (Optional)
    - **Key Outputs:** A message printed to the AI's execution log / output stream.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Can be called standalone or by a promptApp. If a promptApp provides an identically named component, the app-specific one should take precedence.
