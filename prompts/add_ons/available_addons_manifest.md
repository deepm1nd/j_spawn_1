# Available Prompt Add-ons

To use an add-on, include its **app name (which is its folder name)** in the `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` block of your main spawn prompt (which incorporates the content of `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`). Add-on "apps" are subdirectories located within the directory specified by `User_Path_Addons_Dir` in your `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` (typically `prompts/add_ons/` when setting up your target repository). The Planning AI will then read the primary instruction file for a selected add-on from `[User_Path_Addons_Dir]/[addon_app_name]/[addon_app_name].txt`. Each add-on app folder may also contain other supporting files or sub-frameworks for that specific add-on.

- **`task_resumption_addon`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Inheritable Utility
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `task_resumption_addon/task_resumption_addon.txt`) instructs Task AIs to create and maintain a resumable prompt for their current task. This helps in continuing work seamlessly if a task is interrupted.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Typically appended to task prompts generated by a primary orchestration add-on (like `task_spawning_addon`) to enhance Task AI robustness.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be inherited by Task AIs.

- **`task_spawning_addon`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Primary Orchestration Add-on
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `task_spawning_addon/task_spawning_addon.txt`) enables the core project planning and task generation functionality. When selected, the Planning AI will generate a main development plan, a Task Launch Plan (`00_task_launch_plan.md`), and individual task prompt files for subsequent Task AIs.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Essential for using the MPS framework to break down a user's project request into a structured, phased plan with detailed, executable tasks. This is the primary add-on for project decomposition and multi-task coordination.
    - **Key Inputs (from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]`):** Uses general paths like `Prompts Folder`, `Submodule Plan Destination`, `User-Specified Task Output Base Path`.
    - **Key Outputs:** `[Main Project Plan].md`, `00_task_launch_plan.md`, multiple `p<Phase>_t<Task>_*.txt` task prompts.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Works in conjunction with `prompts/iep/Core_Planning_Instructions.txt` which provides foundational parsing and utility instructions. Path configurations from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` (within `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`) are used extensively. Other selected add-on apps (like `task_resumption_addon`) will have their primary instruction file content appended to the task prompts generated by this add-on; the `task_spawning_addon` app's own primary instruction content is not appended.

- **`create_research_report`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Primary Process Add-on
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `create_research_report/create_research_report.txt`) guides the AI in generating a research report based on provided inputs. It involves parsing user configurations, ingesting and validating input documents and web links, performing research (including following references to a specified depth), iteratively generating content based on desired output depth, and finally assembling the report.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** To automate or assist in the creation of research reports. It can be used to synthesize information from various sources, follow research trails, and produce structured outputs from outlines to detailed reports with AI-generated insights.
    - **Key Inputs (from `USER_create_research_report_CONFIG.txt` located in `create_research_report/`):**
        - `PROPOSED_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS` (Optional)
        - `GUIDELINES_DOC_PATHS` (Optional)
        - `ADDITIONAL_WEB_LINKS_FILE` (Optional)
        - `EXEMPLAR_DOCS` (Optional)
        - `GENERAL_INPUT_DOCS` (Required)
        - `PRIMARY_INPUT_DOC_PATH` (Required)
        - `ITERATIVE_OUTPUT_DEPTH` (Required, 0-3)
        - `REFERENCE_FOLLOWING_DEPTH` (Required, 0-2)
    - **Key Outputs:** Generic research reports. The specific names and structure will depend on the inputs and the execution of the add-on's logic. Output location is typically determined by general path configurations or user instructions in the main prompt.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be used as a primary add-on. Relies on its specific `USER_create_research_report_CONFIG.txt` file for configuration. If selected alongside other primary add-ons like `task_spawning_addon`, the user's overarching request in the main spawn prompt must clearly direct which process is primary.

- **`test_resolver_component`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Utility / Test Component
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `test_resolver_component/test_resolver_component.txt`) is a dummy component used for testing the component resolution mechanism, especially when a promptApp might provide an app-specific version.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** For framework testing. It prints a message indicating whether the global or an app-specific version was run, and displays the value of a dummy parameter.
    - **Key Inputs (from `USER_test_resolver_component_CONFIG.txt` located in `test_resolver_component/`):**
        - `DUMMY_PARAM` (Optional)
    - **Key Outputs:** A message printed to the AI's execution log / output stream.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Can be called standalone or by a promptApp. If a promptApp provides an identically named component, the app-specific one should take precedence.
