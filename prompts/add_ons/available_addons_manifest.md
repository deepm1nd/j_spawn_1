# Available Prompt Add-ons

To use an add-on, include its filename in the `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` block of your main spawn prompt (which incorporates the content of `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`). Add-ons are located in this `/prompts/add_ons/` directory (when setting up your target repository). The Planning AI will then read these add-on files from the corresponding path in the target repository.

- `task_resumption_addon.txt`: Instructs Task AIs to create and maintain a resumable prompt for their current task. This helps in continuing work seamlessly if a task is interrupted.

- `task_spawning_addon.txt`: Enables the core project planning and task generation functionality. When selected, the Planning AI will generate a main development plan, a Task Launch Plan (`00_task_launch_plan.md`), and individual task prompt files. If this add-on is not selected, this core planning and task generation functionality will not be executed by default, and the Planning AI will rely on other selected add-ons for its primary directives or will perform minimal actions as defined in `Core_Planning_Instructions.txt`.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Essential for using the MPS framework to break down a user's project request into a structured, phased plan with detailed, executable tasks for subsequent AI instances. This is the primary add-on for project decomposition and multi-task coordination.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Works in conjunction with `prompts/iep/Core_Planning_Instructions.txt` which provides foundational parsing and utility instructions. Path configurations from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` (within `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`) are used extensively by this add-on. Other add-ons listed in `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` may be appended to the task prompts generated by this add-on.
