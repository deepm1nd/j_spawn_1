# Available Prompt Add-ons

To use an add-on, include its filename in the `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` block of your main spawn prompt (which incorporates the content of `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`). Add-ons are located in this `/prompts/add_ons/` directory (when setting up your target repository). The Planning AI will then read these add-on files from the corresponding path in the target repository.

- `task_resumption_addon.txt`: Instructs Task AIs to create and maintain a resumable prompt for their current task. This helps in continuing work seamlessly if a task is interrupted. This is typically an "inheritable" add-on, appended to task prompts generated by a primary add-on.

- `task_spawning_addon.txt`:
    - **Type:** Primary Orchestration Add-on
    - **Description:** Enables the core project planning and task generation functionality. When selected, the Planning AI will generate a main development plan, a Task Launch Plan (`00_task_launch_plan.md`), and individual task prompt files for subsequent Task AIs.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Essential for using the MPS framework to break down a user's project request into a structured, phased plan with detailed, executable tasks. This is the primary add-on for project decomposition and multi-task coordination.
    - **Key Inputs (from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]`):** Uses general paths like `Prompts Folder`, `Submodule Plan Destination`, `User-Specified Task Output Base Path`.
    - **Key Outputs:** `[Main Project Plan].md`, `00_task_launch_plan.md`, multiple `p<Phase>_t<Task>_*.txt` task prompts.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Works in conjunction with `prompts/iep/Core_Planning_Instructions.txt` which provides foundational parsing and utility instructions. Path configurations from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` (within `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`) are used extensively. Other selected add-ons (like `task_resumption_addon.txt`) will be appended to the task prompts generated by this add-on; `task_spawning_addon.txt` itself is not appended.

- `build_product_specs_process.txt`:
    - **Type:** Process Add-on
    - **Description:** Guides the AI through a multi-step process to generate a comprehensive set of product specification documents. This includes analyzing provided input and guidance documents, performing guided research (internal document references only), and structuring outputs.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Automates or significantly assists in the creation of initial product specifications, requirements lists, and (optionally) architectural specifications based on user-provided materials and constraints. Intended to be used as a primary directive add-on when `task_spawning_addon.txt` might not be selected, or as a distinct, focused process.
    - **Key Inputs (from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` in `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`):**
        - `PRODUCT_NAME`: Name of the product, used for output filenames.
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_INPUT_DOCS_PATH`: Path to folder with primary input documents (market research, user feedback, etc.).
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_GUIDANCE_DOCS_PATH`: Path to folder with rules, constraints, compliance docs, and style guides.
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_OUTPUT_PATH`: Path to folder where generated specification documents will be saved.
    - **Key Outputs (saved to `PRODUCT_SPECS_OUTPUT_PATH`):**
        - `{PRODUCT_NAME}_product_specification.md`
        - `{PRODUCT_NAME}_product_requirements.md`
        - `{PRODUCT_NAME}_architectural_specification.md` (optional, based on AI's determination of need)
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be used as a primary add-on. Relies on specific path configurations being set by the user in `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]`. If selected alongside `task_spawning_addon.txt`, the user's overarching request in the main spawn prompt must clearly direct which process is primary or how they should interact, as the default MPS logic in `Core_Planning_Instructions.txt` gives precedence to `task_spawning_addon.txt` for breaking down work into sub-tasks.
