# Available Prompt Add-ons

To use an add-on, include its **app name (which is its folder name)** in the `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` block of your main spawn prompt (which incorporates the content of `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`). Add-on "apps" are subdirectories located within the directory specified by `User_Path_Addons_Dir` in your `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` (typically `prompts/add_ons/` when setting up your target repository). The Planning AI will then read the primary instruction file for a selected add-on from `[User_Path_Addons_Dir]/[addon_app_name]/[addon_app_name].txt`. Each add-on app folder may also contain other supporting files or sub-frameworks for that specific add-on.

- **`task_resumption_addon`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Inheritable Utility
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `task_resumption_addon/task_resumption_addon.txt`) instructs Task AIs to create and maintain a resumable prompt for their current task. This helps in continuing work seamlessly if a task is interrupted.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Typically appended to task prompts generated by a primary orchestration add-on (like `task_spawning_addon`) to enhance Task AI robustness.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be inherited by Task AIs.

- **`task_spawning_addon`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Primary Orchestration Add-on
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `task_spawning_addon/task_spawning_addon.txt`) enables the core project planning and task generation functionality. When selected, the Planning AI will generate a main development plan, a Task Launch Plan (`00_task_launch_plan.md`), and individual task prompt files for subsequent Task AIs.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Essential for using the MPS framework to break down a user's project request into a structured, phased plan with detailed, executable tasks. This is the primary add-on for project decomposition and multi-task coordination.
    - **Key Inputs (from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]`):** Uses general paths like `Prompts Folder`, `Submodule Plan Destination`, `User-Specified Task Output Base Path`.
    - **Key Outputs:** `[Main Project Plan].md`, `00_task_launch_plan.md`, multiple `p<Phase>_t<Task>_*.txt` task prompts.
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Works in conjunction with `prompts/iep/Core_Planning_Instructions.txt` which provides foundational parsing and utility instructions. Path configurations from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` (within `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`) are used extensively. Other selected add-on apps (like `task_resumption_addon`) will have their primary instruction file content appended to the task prompts generated by this add-on; the `task_spawning_addon` app's own primary instruction content is not appended.

- **`build_product_specs_process`** (Add-on App)
    - **Type:** Primary Process Add-on
    - **Description:** This add-on app (primary instruction file: `build_product_specs_process/build_product_specs_process.txt`) guides the AI through a multi-step, potentially iterative process to generate a comprehensive set of product specification documents. This includes analyzing provided input and guidance documents, performing guided research (internal document references only, and controlled codebase review), and structuring outputs.
    - **Purpose/Use Case:** Automates or significantly assists in the creation of initial product specifications, requirements lists, and (optionally) architectural specifications based on user-provided materials and constraints. Intended to be used as a primary directive add-on.
    - **Key Inputs (from `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` in `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`):**
        - `PRODUCT_NAME`
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_INPUT_DOCS_PATH`
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_GUIDANCE_DOCS_PATH`
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_OUTPUT_PATH`
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_PRIMARY_INPUT_FILE` (Optional)
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_REF_DEPTH` (Optional, 0-2, default 1)
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_CODEBASE_REVIEW_PREFERENCE` (Optional, "complex", "cursory", "focused", default "cursory")
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_CODEBASE_FOCUS_AREAS` (Optional)
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_ITERATION_DEPTH` (Optional, 0-3, default 0)
        - `PRODUCT_SPECS_PREVIOUS_ITERATION_OUTPUT_PATH` (Optional, required for iteration depth > 0)
    - **Key Outputs (saved to `PRODUCT_SPECS_OUTPUT_PATH`):**
        - `{PRODUCT_NAME}_product_specification_[Dx].md`
        - `{PRODUCT_NAME}_product_requirements_[Dx].md`
        - `{PRODUCT_NAME}_architectural_specification_[Dx].md` (optional)
    - **Compatibility Notes:** Designed to be used as a primary add-on. Relies on specific path configurations being set by the user in `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]`. If selected alongside `task_spawning_addon`, the user's overarching request in the main spawn prompt must clearly direct which process is primary, as the default MPS logic in `Core_Planning_Instructions.txt` gives precedence to the first recognized primary add-on in the user's selection order.
