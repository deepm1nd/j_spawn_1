# Base Information Exchange Protocol (Base IEP) - v0.2 (with Risk Assessment Example)

## 1. Purpose and Philosophy
(Same as v0.1 in `/mps_01/prompts/ipc/Base_IEP.txt`)

## 2. Core Base IEP Fields
(Same core fields as v0.1: Task-ID, Status, Summary, Files-Modified, Notes-To-Next-Jules)
\`\`\`
Task-ID: <Unique identifier for the primary task or context this commit relates to. Often the filename of the initiating prompt or a higher-level tracker ID.>
Status: <Overall status of the Task-ID (or a more specific Sub-Task-ID if provided in Notes-To-Next-Jules) *after* this commit is applied.>
  Allowed values:
    - Not-Started: Initial setup, planning, or pre-work for the task.
    - In-Progress: Active work is ongoing for the task.
    - Blocked: The task cannot proceed. (Details **must** be in Notes-To-Next-Jules).
    - In-Review: Work for a significant milestone or the entire task is awaiting review.
    - Completed: A defined piece of work or the entire task is considered complete and self-tested.
    - Tested: The work has passed formal testing procedures.
Summary: <A concise, imperative summary of the commit's primary purpose (max 72 characters). E.g., "Initialize project structure and add README">
Files-Modified:
  - path/to/file_1.ext: Brief note on change.
  - path/to/file_2.ext: Brief note on change.
  - ... (List key files. Summarize if many, but be clear).
Notes-To-Next-Jules:
<This is a multi-line field for detailed explanations, context, rationale, and crucially, for structured extensions defined by Prompt Add-ons or specific task requirements. See Section 3 for extensibility.>
\`\`\`

## 3. Extensibility Mechanism
(Same as v0.1)

**Example of `Notes-To-Next-Jules` with Extensions (Illustrative):**
\`\`\`
Notes-To-Next-Jules:
This commit implements the core authentication logic and refactors the session manager.

[PLANNING_MPS_PROGRESS]
- Current step in \`_dev_plan.md\`: Step 4.3: Integrate session management
- Percentage complete (approximate for this Sub-Task-ID): 90%
- Key accomplishments in THIS commit:
  - Session management refactored for Redis store.
  - Old file-based session store removed.

[TASK_RESUMPTION_ADDON_STATUS]
- Resumption_Prompt_Location: project_alpha/outputs/p1_t1_auth_service_resumption_prompt.txt (Updated)

[RISK_ASSESSMENT]
- Risk-Level: Medium
- Justification: Refactored a core session component; new dependency on Redis. Thoroughly unit tested, but integration testing is pending for this new store.

[BLOCKERS]
- None

General Notes:
Ensure Redis service is configured and running for subsequent tests.

## 4. Responsibilities
(Same as v0.1)

This Base IEP, with its clear extensibility mechanism, provides a flexible yet standardized foundation for communication across diverse AI-driven tasks and workflows.
