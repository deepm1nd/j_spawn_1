Hello Jules,

You are picking up an ongoing task to develop and iteratively refine a "Master Prompt Segment" (MPS) framework. This framework is designed to guide a "Planning AI" in generating structured project plans and task prompts for other AI instances.

**Current Iteration's Work Context:**
*   The primary output of this ongoing effort is being developed within `/mps_XX/` directory structures (e.g., `/mps_01/`, `/mps_02/`). You will typically work on the latest or a specified version.
*   Key deliverables within each `/mps_XX/` folder typically include:
    *   `updated_Master_Prompt_Segment.txt` (or `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`).
    *   `prompts/ipc/Base_IEP.txt` (content for user's Base IEP).
    *   `prompts/add_ons/task_resumption_addon.txt` (content for user's add-on).
    *   `prompts/p_gritos_dev_plan_spawn_EXAMPLE.md` (example of how user structures their main spawn prompt).
    *   Other guides and examples.
*   `HANDOFF_NOTES.md`: Contains a log of significant decisions, changes, and the state of work from previous Jules instances. **Crucially, it now also contains a section `## MPS Performance Feedback Log`. Your first steps should be to review BOTH the general handoff notes AND this specific feedback log thoroughly.**

**Your Immediate Task:**
1.  **Review `HANDOFF_NOTES.md` in the relevant `/mps_XX/` folder, paying close attention to the `## MPS Performance Feedback Log` section.** This contains critical information.
2.  Review the User's Latest Feedback/Request (provided immediately following this prompt).
3.  Understand the Current State based on `HANDOFF_NOTES.md` and current files.
4.  Formulate a Plan to address the user's request. This plan should also include a step to update both the general section of `HANDOFF_NOTES.md` and, if applicable, add a new entry to the `## MPS Performance Feedback Log`.
5.  Seek User Approval for your plan.
6.  Execute and Iterate.

**Key Objectives for the MPS Framework (that you are helping to build):**
1.  Highly effective at eliminating or mitigating merge conflicts.
2.  Easy for end-users and Task AIs to use.
3.  Highly parallelized where safe.
4.  Using readable file names.
5.  Enabling better progress tracking.
6.  Providing ways to communicate problems/requests between tasks.
7.  Open to other recommendations for improvements.
8.  Supportive of AI-automated PR creation.

**Before you finish your session:**
*   You **must** update the general section of `/mps_XX/HANDOFF_NOTES.md` with your session's work.
*   You **must also add a new, detailed entry to the `## MPS Performance Feedback Log` section of `/mps_XX/HANDOFF_NOTES.md`** if you or the user have new observations on MPS performance, ambiguities, or suggestions for refinement based on your session's work or any tests conducted. Follow the established entry structure for the feedback log.
*   Ensure all your deliverables for this MPS refinement task are committed appropriately.

The user is looking for your help to continue improving this MPS framework. Please confirm your understanding and ask any clarifying questions before proceeding.
