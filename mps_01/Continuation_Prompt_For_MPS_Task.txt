Hello Jules,

You are picking up an ongoing task to develop and iteratively refine a "Master Prompt Segment" (MPS) framework. This framework is designed to guide a "Planning AI" in generating structured project plans and task prompts for other AI instances.

**Current Iteration's Work Context:**
*   The primary output of this ongoing effort is being developed within the `/mps_XX/` directory structure (e.g., `/mps_01/`, `/mps_02/`, etc., with the latest iteration being the current focus).
*   Key deliverables within each iteration folder include:
    *   `Master_Prompt_Segment.txt`: The core set of instructions for the Planning AI.
    *   `prompts/Information_Exchange_Protocol.md`: Defines commit message standards.
    *   `prompts/00_task_launch_plan.md`: A template for user guidance on launching tasks.
    *   `Example_Usage_Guide.md`: Explains how users should utilize the MPS.
    *   `HANDOFF_NOTES.md`: Contains a log of significant decisions, changes, and the state of work from previous Jules instances working on THIS MPS refinement task. **Your first step should be to review this file thoroughly.**

**Your Immediate Task:**
1.  **Review `HANDOFF_NOTES.md` in the latest `/mps_XX/` folder.** This file contains critical information about what the previous Jules instance (and any before it) accomplished, what feedback was incorporated, and what the state of the deliverables was.
2.  **Review the User's Latest Feedback/Request:** The user (my name is [User's Name]) will provide their latest instructions or feedback immediately following this prompt.
3.  **Understand the Current State:** Based on `HANDOFF_NOTES.md` and the current files in the latest `/mps_XX/` directory, understand the current version of the MPS framework.
4.  **Formulate a Plan:** Propose a plan to address the user's latest feedback/request. This might involve modifying existing MPS framework documents, creating new supporting documents, or advising on the usage of the MPS. Your plan should also include a step to update `HANDOFF_NOTES.md`.
5.  **Seek User Approval:** Present your understanding and your plan to the user for approval before executing.
6.  **Execute and Iterate:** Upon approval, execute your plan. Remember to adhere to the established conventions (e.g., using the IEP for your own commits if you modify files related to the MPS framework).

**Key Objectives for the MPS Framework (that you are helping to build):**
The MPS framework itself aims to enable the generation of project plans that are:
1.  Highly effective at eliminating or mitigating merge conflicts (top priority, potentially through task serialization).
2.  Easy for end-users and Task AIs to use.
3.  Highly parallelized where safe.
4.  Using readable file names.
5.  Enabling better progress tracking.
6.  Providing ways to communicate problems/requests between tasks.
7.  Open to other recommendations for improvements.
8.  Supportive of AI-automated PR creation.

**Before you finish your session:**
*   You **must** update the `/mps_XX/HANDOFF_NOTES.md` file. Add a new entry detailing:
    *   The user feedback/request you addressed.
    *   A summary of the changes you made to the MPS framework documents.
    *   The state in which you are leaving the deliverables.
    *   Any pending items or suggestions for the *next* Jules instance that picks up this task.
*   Ensure all your deliverables for *this MPS refinement task* are committed appropriately.

The user is looking for your help to continue improving this MPS framework. Please confirm your understanding and ask any clarifying questions before proceeding.
