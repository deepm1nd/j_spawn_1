# Task Launch Plan - Phase [Phase Number]: [Phase Title]

**Overall Phase Objective:** [Briefly describe the main goal of this Phase, derived from P-AI's decomposition]

**Environment & Tooling Assumptions:**
*   [P-AI to list any specific tools, libraries, or environment variables the E-AI should assume are available. e.g., "Python 3.9 available", "Access to `requests` library version X.Y"]

**Input Files for this Phase:**
*   [List expected input files, their locations (relative to phase directory or a shared root), and brief descriptions. e.g.,
    *   `../shared_data/input_dataset.csv`: Raw customer data.
    *   `./config/phase_settings.json`: Configuration parameters for this phase.]

**Tasks for this Phase:**
*(Tasks are to be executed in parallel by the E-AI unless a specific sequence is indicated below due to dependencies, e.g., shared file modifications.)*

---
**Task ID:** [PhaseNumber]-[TaskNumber] (e.g., 01-01)
**Task Title:** [Descriptive title, e.g., "Cleanse Customer Data"]
**Objective:** [Clear, concise statement of what this task must achieve.]
**Inputs:**
    *   [Specific files or data this task uses from "Input Files for this Phase" or generated by a *previous, sequenced* task in this phase.]
**Instructions:**
    1.  [Step-by-step instructions for the E-AI. Be explicit.]
    2.  [If generating code, specify language, desired output (e.g., function, script, class), and key requirements like error handling or logging.]
    3.  [If modifying a file, specify if it's an overwrite or modification. If modification, P-AI should specify if E-AI should use diffs or provide full content.]
**Deliverables:**
    *   [Expected output files, their names, and locations (relative to phase directory). e.g., `cleaned_customer_data.csv`]
    *   [If the task is to generate a report or analysis, describe its expected content and format.]
**Success Criteria:** [How to determine if the task was completed successfully. e.g., "Output file `cleaned_customer_data.csv` is created and contains no null values in the 'email' column."]
**Potential Issues/Edge Cases:** [Optional: P-AI notes any foreseeable issues E-AI should be mindful of.]

**(Repeat for each task in the Phase)**
---

**Final Phase Deliverables:**
*   [List all key files that should exist upon successful completion of all tasks in this phase.]

**Quality Checks for E-AI (Self-Verification):**
*   [P-AI to list 2-3 high-level checks the E-AI should perform on its own work for this phase before concluding. e.g., "Ensure all generated Python scripts are linted and have basic error handling." "Verify all output files listed in 'Final Phase Deliverables' are present."]
