# Example Usage Guide: P-AI Output for E-AI

This guide explains how to use the files generated by the Planning AI (P-AI) to instruct an Execution AI (E-AI).

**1. Overview:**

The P-AI has decomposed the User's request into multiple "Phases." For each Phase, there's a dedicated directory (e.g., `phase_01/`, `phase_02/`) containing a `00_task_launch_plan.md`. This Task Launch Plan (TLP) is the primary instruction set for the E-AI for that specific phase.

The `mps_01/prompts/Information_Exchange_Protocol.md` (IEP) file dictates how the E-AI should format its responses and handle communication. It's crucial that the E-AI is instructed to adhere to this protocol.

**2. Execution Flow (User to E-AI):**

*   **Step 1: Provide IEP to E-AI:**
    *   Before starting any phase, the E-AI must be provided with the content of `mps_01/prompts/Information_Exchange_Protocol.md`.
    *   The E-AI should be instructed to strictly follow this protocol for all its responses.

*   **Step 2: Execute Phase by Phase:**
    *   For each Phase (e.g., starting with `phase_01/`):
        *   Provide the E-AI with the content of the corresponding `phase_XX/00_task_launch_plan.md`.
        *   Ensure the E-AI has access to any input files specified in the TLP (these might be from a previous phase or provided by the User).
        *   The E-AI will perform the tasks as listed in the TLP. It should work on tasks in parallel unless a specific sequence is noted in the TLP (due to dependencies like shared file modifications).
        *   The E-AI will provide responses for each task (and for the overall phase, if specified) according to the IEP.

*   **Step 3: Review E-AI Output:**
    *   Review the E-AI's responses, deliverables, and any reported issues for each phase.
    *   If a task is "Blocked" or "Failed," the P-AI may need to be invoked again by the User with the E-AI's feedback to generate a revised TLP or new instructions.

*   **Step 4: Proceed to Next Phase:**
    *   Once a phase is satisfactorily completed, move to the next phase (e.g., `phase_02/00_task_launch_plan.md`) and repeat Step 2.

**3. Handling Merge Conflicts (E-AI Guidance):**

*   The TLP may specify a sequence for tasks that could conflict (e.g., by modifying the same file). The E-AI *must* respect this sequencing.
*   If the E-AI, despite P-AI's planning, identifies a potential merge conflict not explicitly addressed by sequencing in the TLP (e.g., two parallel tasks unexpectedly attempt to write to the same new file), it should:
    1.  Complete one of the conflicting tasks.
    2.  In its IEP response for that task, clearly state the conflict it encountered and which file was involved.
    3.  Pause execution of the *other* directly conflicting task(s).
    4.  Mark the paused task(s) as "Blocked" in their IEP response, referencing the conflict.
*   The User/P-AI will then need to resolve this by providing updated instructions, potentially serializing the tasks in a new TLP.

**4. Example E-AI Invocation (Conceptual):**

Imagine you are programmatically invoking an E-AI:

```python
# Conceptual Python-like pseudocode
e_ai = ExecutionAI()

# Load IEP
with open("mps_01/prompts/Information_Exchange_Protocol.md", "r") as f:
    iep_content = f.read()
e_ai.set_instruction_protocol(iep_content)

# --- Process Phase 1 ---
phase_1_tlp_path = "phase_01/00_task_launch_plan.md"
with open(phase_1_tlp_path, "r") as f:
    phase_1_tlp_content = f.read()

# E-AI processes tasks in TLP, using IEP for responses
phase_1_results = e_ai.execute_task_plan(
    plan_content=phase_1_tlp_content,
    # E-AI needs to know its current phase directory to resolve relative paths
    current_phase_directory="phase_01/",
    # E-AI might need access to a shared directory if TLPs reference it
    shared_data_directory="shared_data/"
)

for result in phase_1_results:
    print(f"Task {result.task_id}: {result.status}")
    print(f"Summary: {result.summary}")
    # ... and so on, matching IEP structure

# If phase_1_results are good, proceed to phase_2, etc.
```

This guide provides a high-level workflow. Specific E-AI capabilities and invocation methods will vary. The key is the structured information flow from P-AI to E-AI via the TLP and IEP.
