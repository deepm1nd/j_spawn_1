# Base Information Exchange Protocol (Base IEP)

## 1. Purpose and Philosophy

This document defines the Base Information Exchange Protocol (Base IEP), a minimal, universal set of fields for standardizing Git commit messages. The primary goals of the Base IEP are:

*   **Clarity and Traceability:** Provide a consistent way to understand the purpose and context of every commit.
*   **Universal Applicability:** Serve as a foundational communication structure for tasks performed by individual AI instances or teams of collaborating AI instances.
*   **Extensibility:** Allow for specialized information to be added by specific "Prompt Add-ons" or for particular task types without altering the core fields. This ensures the base remains simple while accommodating diverse needs.

The philosophy is to keep the top-level structure lean and rely on a designated free-form field (`Notes-To-Next-Jules`) for structured extensions.

## 2. Core Base IEP Fields

Every commit message **must** adhere to the following core field structure. These fields are considered fundamental for any task.

\`\`\`
Task-ID: <Unique identifier for the primary task or context this commit relates to. Often the filename of the initiating prompt or a higher-level tracker ID.>
Status: <Overall status of the Task-ID (or a more specific Sub-Task-ID if provided in Notes-To-Next-Jules) *after* this commit is applied.>
  Allowed values:
    - Not-Started: Initial setup, planning, or pre-work for the task.
    - In-Progress: Active work is ongoing for the task.
    - Blocked: The task cannot proceed. (Details **must** be in Notes-To-Next-Jules).
    - In-Review: Work for a significant milestone or the entire task is awaiting review.
    - Completed: A defined piece of work or the entire task is considered complete and self-tested.
    - Tested: The work has passed formal testing procedures.
Summary: <A concise, imperative summary of the commit's primary purpose (max 72 characters). E.g., "Initialize project structure and add README">
Files-Modified:
  - path/to/file_1.ext: Brief note on change.
  - path/to/file_2.ext: Brief note on change.
  - ... (List key files. Summarize if many, but be clear).
Notes-To-Next-Jules:
<This is a multi-line field for detailed explanations, context, rationale, and crucially, for structured extensions defined by Prompt Add-ons or specific task requirements. See Section 3 for extensibility.>
\`\`\`

## 3. Extensibility Mechanism

The Base IEP is designed to be extended without altering its core fields. Extensions are primarily achieved by defining structured content (e.g., key-value pairs, special tags, Markdown sections) within the `Notes-To-Next-Jules` field.

**Guidelines for Extensions:**

*   **Prefixing/Tagging:** Extensions should use clear, unique prefixes or tags to identify their purpose and avoid clashes.
    *   Example: `[ADDON_NAME_FEATURE_STATUS]: Details...`
    *   Example: `[PROGRESS_TRACKING_PERCENT_COMPLETE]: 70%`
*   **Documentation:** Any "Prompt Add-on" or process that introduces specific structured extensions to be used within `Notes-To-Next-Jules` **must** document these extensions as part of the add-on's definition or its usage guide.
*   **Clarity:** Extensions should be human-readable and provide clear value.
*   **Separation:** Use newlines or clear separators (like Markdown headings) within `Notes-To-Next-Jules` to distinguish different pieces of extended information from general notes.

**Example of `Notes-To-Next-Jules` with Extensions (Illustrative - actual tags depend on add-ons used):**
\`\`\`
Notes-To-Next-Jules:
This commit implements the core authentication logic.

[PLANNING_MPS_PROGRESS]
- Current step in \`_dev_plan.md\`: Step 4.2: Implement token generation
- Percentage complete (approximate for this Sub-Task-ID): 80%
- Key accomplishments in THIS commit:
  - JWT token generation implemented.

[TASK_RESUMPTION_ADDON_STATUS]
- Resumption_Prompt_Location: project_alpha/outputs/p1_t1_auth_service_resumption_prompt.txt (Updated)

[BLOCKERS]
- Waiting for clarification on session timeout.

General Notes:
The token expiration is currently set to 1 hour.

## 4. Responsibilities

*   **AI Instances:** Must adhere to the Base IEP core fields in all commits. If guided by a Prompt Add-on that defines extensions, the AI must populate those extensions correctly within `Notes-To-Next-Jules`.
*   **Prompt Add-on Designers:** Must clearly define any IEP extensions their add-on introduces and how they fit within the `Notes-To-Next-Jules` field. They should not redefine Base IEP core fields.
*   **Users/Reviewers:** Can rely on the Base IEP fields for consistent top-level information and then parse `Notes-To-Next-Jules` for more detailed, structured information provided by various add-ons or task-specific reporting.

This Base IEP, with its clear extensibility mechanism, provides a flexible yet standardized foundation for communication across diverse AI-driven tasks and workflows.
