Subject: Ensure Secure and Reliable Audit Trail for gRiTOS Logging Service

**Main Task Reference:**
This task corresponds to the following item in `/plan/gritos_dev_plan.md`, section "3.7.6. System Monitoring & Logging Service":
"Task: Ensure secure and reliable audit trail. (SoP 2.2.6)"

**Instructions:**

1.  **Create Sub-Development Plan:**
    *   Develop a detailed sub-development plan focused on ensuring the security and reliability of the audit trail provided by the Logging Service (`M3_S7_SS6_T1`).
    *   This plan should address:
        *   **Security of Log Data:**
            *   **Access Control:** How access to stored log data (if persisted) is controlled. This might involve specific capabilities to read logs or manage the logging service.
            *   **Tamper Resistance/Evidence:** Mechanisms to make log entries tamper-evident (e.g., chaining hashes of log entries, digital signatures on log batches if using secure storage `M3_S8_T3`).
            *   **Confidentiality:** If log data might contain sensitive information, consider if encryption of stored logs is necessary (potentially using the Secure Storage service).
            *   **Protection of the Logging Service:** Ensuring the Logging Service component itself is protected and cannot be easily compromised or subverted to falsify logs.
        *   **Reliability of Logging:**
            *   **Persistence:** Strategy for persisting logs across reboots if required (e.g., logging to a file system on non-volatile media). This involves interaction with the File System service (`M3_S7_SS3`).
            *   **Log Loss Prevention:** How the service handles high loads or temporary unavailability of storage (e.g., robust buffering, strategies for when buffers overflow - drop oldest, drop newest, error back to caller).
            *   **Atomic Writes (for critical logs):** Ensuring critical log entries are fully committed to stable storage.
        *   **Log Integrity Verification:** Tools or mechanisms to verify the integrity of the audit trail (e.g., checking chained hashes or signatures).
    *   Save this plan as `/plan/generated_subplans/user_space_services/system_monitoring_logging/M3_S7_SS6_T3_Ensure_Secure_Reliable_Audit_Trail_dev_plan.md`.

2.  **Implement the Task (Enhancements to Logging Service):**
    *   Implement the security and reliability enhancements for the Logging Service based on your sub-development plan.
    *   This might involve:
        *   Adding cryptographic operations for tamper evidence.
        *   Integrating with a File System service for persistent log storage.
        *   Implementing more robust buffering and error handling.
    *   Adhere to the overall gRiTOS architecture, principles, and constraints outlined in:
        *   `/plan/gritos_dev_plan.md`
        *   `/plan/archive/gritos_product_specification.md` (SoP), especially section 2.2.6 (System Monitoring & Logging - "secure and reliable audit trail").
        *   `/gritos_product_requirements_full.md`.

3.  **Document Next Steps:**
    *   Consider and document next steps, including:
        *   Development of tools for secure log viewing and analysis.
        *   Testing the resilience of the logging system to crashes and high load.
        *   Periodic auditing procedures for reviewing log integrity.
    *   Save this document as `/plan/generated_subplans/user_space_services/system_monitoring_logging/M3_S7_SS6_T3_Ensure_Secure_Reliable_Audit_Trail_next_steps.md`.

4.  **Commit Messages:**
    *   Adhere strictly to the Information Exchange Protocol defined in section 7 of `/plan/gritos_dev_plan.md` for all commit messages.

**Context & References:**
-   **SoP Sections:** 2.2.6.
-   **ReqFull IDs:** `GRITOS-REQ-FNC-SVC-LOG-00001`.
-   A secure and reliable audit trail is crucial for security analysis, incident response, and potentially for meeting certification requirements.

**Dependencies:**
-   Requires a functional Logging Service (`M3_S7_SS6_T1`).
-   May require the Secure Storage service (`M3_S8_T3`) for encrypted or signed logs.
-   May require the File System service (`M3_S7_SS3`) for persistent log storage.
-   Depends on cryptographic libraries/primitives for hashing/signatures.

Focus on making the logging mechanism trustworthy and resilient.
Good luck, Jules!
