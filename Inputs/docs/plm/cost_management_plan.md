# Cost Management Plan

## 1. Introduction
    1.1. Purpose of this Document
    This Cost Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for planning, estimating, budgeting, managing, and controlling costs within the gRiTOS project. The primary aim is to ensure that project resources, particularly personnel effort, are utilized effectively.

    1.2. Scope of this Plan
    This plan applies to all activities related to managing the "cost" (primarily personnel effort and significant resource utilization) of the gRiTOS project.
    **Note:** For the gRiTOS project, 'cost' primarily refers to the estimation, allocation, and tracking of personnel effort (e.g., person-days) and the utilization of significant project resources (e.g., specialized hardware/software). Detailed financial tracking in monetary terms is generally not the primary focus at the project level, unless specified for particular sub-projects or procurements involving external expenditures.

    1.3. Definitions and Acronyms
    *   PMP: Project Management Plan
    *   WBS: Work Breakdown Structure

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities
    2.1. Project Manager
    Responsible for overseeing all cost management activities, including effort estimation, resource allocation planning, and monitoring effort expenditure against plans.

    2.2. Relevant Leads (e.g., Technical Leads)
    Responsible for providing effort estimates for activities within their domains, managing resource utilization for their teams, and reporting on effort expended.

    2.3. Team Members
    Responsible for accurately recording effort spent on project tasks and for utilizing resources efficiently.

## 3. Cost Management Process
    3.1. Cost Estimating (Effort Estimating)
        3.1.1. Inputs
        *   Scope Baseline (WBS, WBS Dictionary)
        *   Schedule Management Plan (activity list, duration estimates)
        *   Resource Management Plan (resource requirements, rates if applicable for external resources)
        *   Risk Register
        *   Organizational Process Assets (historical data, estimating policies)
        3.1.2. Activities/Process
        *   Developing an approximation of the resources (primarily personnel effort) needed to complete project activities.
        *   Utilizing techniques like expert judgment, analogous estimating, parametric estimating, and bottom-up estimating (summing effort for WBS components).
        3.1.3. Outputs/Deliverables
        *   Activity Effort Estimates
        *   Basis of Estimates (how estimates were derived)
        *   Updated project documents

    3.2. Budget Determination (Effort Baseline)
        3.2.1. Inputs
        *   Activity Effort Estimates
        *   Basis of Estimates
        *   Scope Baseline
        *   Project Schedule
        *   Resource Calendars
        *   Contracts (if applicable for external resources/procurement)
        3.2.2. Activities/Process
        *   Aggregating the estimated effort for individual activities or work packages to establish an authorized effort baseline.
        *   Aligning effort estimates with project phases and major milestones.
        *   For any monetary costs (e.g., procurement), these would be budgeted separately and approved.
        3.1.3. Outputs/Deliverables
        *   Effort Baseline (time-phased representation of planned effort)
        *   Project Funding Requirements (if monetary budget applies)
        *   Updated project documents

    3.3. Cost Baseline Management
        3.3.1. Inputs
        *   Effort Baseline
        *   Change Management Process
        3.3.2. Activities/Process
        *   Defining how the effort baseline will be managed and controlled.
        *   Establishing procedures for approving changes to the baseline.
        *   Ensuring that any changes to the scope, schedule, or resources that impact effort are reflected in the baseline through formal change control.
        3.1.3. Outputs/Deliverables
        *   Procedures for managing the effort baseline.

## 4. Monitoring and Controlling
    4.1. Cost Control (Effort Control)
    *   Monitoring the status of the project to update project effort "costs" (expended effort) and managing changes to the effort baseline.
    *   Tracking actual effort expended against planned effort.
    *   Analyzing variances in effort (e.g., Effort Variance, Effort Performance Index).
    *   Identifying causes of effort variances and implementing corrective or preventive actions.
    *   Managing changes to the effort baseline through the Change Management Process.
    *   For any monetary costs, financial control processes defined by the organization would apply.

    4.2. Reporting Requirements
    *   Effort expenditure and performance will be reported as part of regular project status reports.
    *   This includes planned vs. actual effort, effort variance, and forecasts for effort at completion.

    4.3. Change Control
    *   All changes to the effort baseline must follow the procedures outlined in the [`Change Management Process.md`](./Change%20Management%20Process.md).
    *   This includes an analysis of the impact on project scope, schedule, resources, and risks.
    *   Updates to this Cost Management Plan also follow the Change Management Process.

## 5. Summary and Document Maintenance
    5.1. Summary of Key Principles
    *   Project "costs" are primarily measured in terms of personnel effort.
    *   Effort is estimated based on the WBS and project activities.
    *   An effort baseline is established and managed.
    *   Effort expenditure is monitored, and variances are controlled.
    *   Changes to the effort baseline are managed through a formal change control process.

    5.2. Document Review and Update Cycle
    *   This Cost Management Plan is a living document and will be reviewed at key project milestones and updated as necessary.
    *   Updates to this plan are managed via the [`Change Management Process.md`](./Change%20Management%20Process.md).
