### 3.4. Implementation-Related Documentation
- Source Code (well-commented)
- API Documentation (e.g., generated via `rustdoc` from source code comments)
- Build and Configuration Procedures/Scripts
- Bill of Materials (BoM - for hardware and key software COTS/OSS)

### 3.5. Test Documentation (Verification & Validation)
- Master Test Plan (overall strategy, potentially part of QMP)

## 4. Documentation Standards and Processes

### 4.1. Documentation Templates and Style Guide
- Standard templates will be developed and maintained for key document types (e.g., SRS, SAD, DDS, Test Plan).
- A project-wide Style Guide will define writing style (e.g., clarity, conciseness, terminology), formatting standards (fonts, headings), and conventions for diagrams and figures. Markdown is the preferred format for most textual documents. PlantUML or Mermaid may be used for embedded diagrams.

### 4.2. Documentation Lifecycle
All formal project documents will follow a defined lifecycle:
1.  **Drafting:** Creation by the assigned author(s)/engineering team.
2.  **Peer Review:** Review by other engineers or SMEs for technical accuracy and completeness.
3.  **Formal Review:** Review by QA, relevant leads, and stakeholders for compliance, clarity, and approval.
4.  **Approval:** Formal sign-off by designated authorities.
5.  **Baselining:** Approved document placed under configuration control as per the SCMP.
6.  **Maintenance:** Updates managed via the Change Management Process.
7.  **Archival/Retirement:** At project end or when superseded.

### 4.3. Review Process
- Reviews will be planned and tracked. Checklists may be used to ensure thoroughness, covering technical content, clarity, completeness, standard adherence, and traceability.
- Feedback will be documented, and authors are responsible for addressing review comments. Resolution of major comments must be verified before approval.

The formal review process for documents follows the guidelines for Technical Reviews detailed in the [Quality Management Plan](./quality_management_plan.md#42-technical-reviews-and-audits) (QMP Section 4.2).

### 4.4. Version Control for Documentation
All documents identified as CIs will be version-controlled in the project's Git repository, as specified in the SCMP. This includes maintaining a revision history for each document.

### 4.5. Documentation Storage, Access, and Distribution
- The central Git repository will serve as the primary storage for all version-controlled documentation.
- A project Wiki or shared document platform may be used for more dynamic information or collaborative drafting before formal baselining.
- Access permissions will be managed via repository settings.
- Approved, baselined documents will be made available to the project team and relevant stakeholders, potentially through a published documentation portal for releases.

## 5. Documentation Tools
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Text Editing:** Markdown editors (e.g., VS Code with extensions), text editors.
- **Diagramming:** PlantUML, Mermaid (for text-based, version-controllable diagrams), or other approved vector graphics tools.
- **API Documentation:** `rustdoc` (for Rust source code).
- **Requirements Management:** [Specify tool if used, e.g., JIRA with specific issue types, dedicated RM tool].
- **Collaborative Platform:** [Specify if used, e.g., Project Wiki, Confluence].

## 6. Documentation Plan Maintenance
This Documentation Plan will be reviewed at major project milestones (e.g., end of PLM phases) or in response to significant changes in project scope, standards, or processes. Updates to this plan will be managed via the project's Change Management Process.
