    1.2. Scope of this Plan
    This plan applies to all activities related to defining project tasks, sequencing them, estimating durations, developing the schedule, and controlling it throughout the gRiTOS project lifecycle.

    1.3. Definitions and Acronyms
    *   PMP: Project Management Plan
    *   WBS: Work Breakdown Structure
    *   PM: Project Manager
    *   [Add other relevant acronyms as needed]

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities
    2.1. Project Manager
    Responsible for developing, maintaining, and controlling the overall project schedule. Ensures adherence to this plan and coordinates with leads for updates.

    2.2. Relevant Leads (e.g., Technical Leads)
    Responsible for defining and estimating durations for activities within their domains, providing updates on progress, and identifying potential schedule risks or delays.

    2.3. Team Members
    Responsible for executing project activities as per the schedule, reporting progress, and promptly communicating any issues that may impact the schedule.

## 4. Monitoring and Controlling
    4.1. Schedule Control
    *   Monitoring the status of project activities to update project progress and manage changes to the schedule baseline.
    *   Comparing actual progress against the planned schedule.
    *   Identifying schedule variances and determining their causes.
    *   Implementing corrective or preventive actions.
    *   Managing schedule change requests through the Change Management Process.

    4.2. Reporting Requirements
    *   Schedule performance will be reported as part of regular project status reports, including updates to milestones and key deliverables.
    *   Variance analysis (e.g., Schedule Variance - SV, Schedule Performance Index - SPI) may be used.

    4.3. Change Control
    *   All changes to the project schedule baseline must follow the procedures outlined in the [`Change Management Process.md`](./Change%20Management%20Process.md).
    *   This includes impact analysis on scope, cost, resources, and risks.
    *   Updates to this Schedule Management Plan also follow the Change Management Process.

## 5. Summary and Document Maintenance
    5.1. Summary of Key Principles
    *   Project activities are clearly defined, sequenced, and estimated.
    *   A realistic and achievable project schedule is developed and baselined.
    *   Schedule progress is actively monitored and controlled.
    *   Changes to the schedule are managed through a formal change control process.

    5.2. Document Review and Update Cycle
    *   This Schedule Management Plan is a living document and will be reviewed at key project milestones and updated as necessary.
    *   Updates to this plan are managed via the [`Change Management Process.md`](./Change%20Management%20Process.md).
