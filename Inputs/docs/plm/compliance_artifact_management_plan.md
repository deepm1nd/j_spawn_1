# Compliance Artifact Management Plan

## 1. Introduction
    1.1. Purpose of this Document
    This Compliance Artifact Management Plan outlines the processes and responsibilities for identifying, generating, collecting, reviewing, approving, storing, and managing the work products and evidence (collectively referred to as "artifacts") required to demonstrate compliance with specified standards and regulations applicable to the gRiTOS project.

    1.2. Scope of this Plan
    This plan applies to all artifacts required to demonstrate compliance with standards such as ISO 26262 (Functional Safety), ASPICE (Process Maturity), relevant cybersecurity standards (e.g., ISO/SAE 21434 concepts), and any other regulatory or quality management system requirements identified for the gRiTOS project. It covers the entire lifecycle of these artifacts.

    1.3. Definitions and Acronyms
    *   PMP: Project Management Plan
    *   QMP: Quality Management Plan
    *   SCMP: Software Configuration Management Plan (or general Configuration Management Plan)
