## 4. Monitoring and Controlling
    4.1. Scope Verification and Control
    *   **Scope Verification:** Formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. This involves reviews, inspections, and demonstrations to ensure deliverables meet acceptance criteria.
    *   **Scope Control:** Monitoring the status of the project and product scope and managing changes to the scope baseline. This ensures that all requested changes and recommended corrective or preventive actions are processed through the integrated change control process.

    4.2. Reporting Requirements
    *   Scope performance will be reported as part of regular project status reports.
    *   This includes progress against the WBS, status of deliverables, and any scope change requests.

    4.3. Change Control
    *   All changes to the project scope baseline must follow the procedures outlined in the [`Change Management Process.md`](./Change%20Management%20Process.md).
    *   This includes submitting a formal change request, impact analysis, CCB review, and approval before implementation.
    *   Updates to this Scope Management Plan also follow the Change Management Process.

## 5. Summary and Document Maintenance
    5.1. Summary of Key Principles
    *   The project scope is clearly defined and documented.
    *   A WBS is used to break down work into manageable components.
    *   Scope is verified against requirements and acceptance criteria.
    *   Changes to scope are managed through a formal change control process.

    5.2. Document Review and Update Cycle
    *   This Scope Management Plan is a living document and will be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary.
    *   Updates to this plan are managed via the [`Change Management Process.md`](./Change%20Management%20Process.md).
