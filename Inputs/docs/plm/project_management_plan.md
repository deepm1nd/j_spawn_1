*   **Phase Gate Reviews:** Formal reviews at the end of each project phase to assess progress, risks, and readiness to proceed.
*   **Project Documentation:** Project plans, specifications, design documents, and reports will be maintained in a central repository (e.g., the Git repository for 'docs-as-code', a designated document management system like Confluence/SharePoint for other artifacts [Clarify primary system(s) and usage]) and serve as a key source of information.
*   **Issue Tracking System:** A dedicated system for tracking issues, actions, and decisions (e.g., JIRA, GitLab Issues, [Specify tool if chosen]).
*   **Email and Collaboration Tools:** For ad-hoc communication and information sharing.

The reporting structure will follow the defined project organization, with team members reporting to their respective leads, and leads reporting to the Project Manager. The PM is responsible for overall communication to senior management and external stakeholders.
Further details are in the [`./communications_management_plan.md`](./communications_management_plan.md).

### 3.5. Decision-Making Process
Decisions within the gRiTOS project will be made through defined processes:
    *   **Phase Gate Reviews:** Major project decisions, such as proceeding to the next phase, will be made during formal Phase Gate Reviews as outlined in the `../gritos_development_plan.md`. These reviews will involve key stakeholders and assess whether phase objectives have been met.
    *   **Change Control Board (CCB):** Changes to established baselines (e.g., requirements, design, plans) will be managed through the Change Control Board (CCB) as per the [`./change_management_process.md`](./change_management_process.md). The CCB will evaluate the impact of proposed changes and approve or reject them.
*   **Technical Decisions:** Technical decisions within specific domains (e.g., software architecture, hardware design) will be made by the designated Technical Leads or Architects responsible for those domains, in consultation with relevant team members and stakeholders. Significant technical decisions with cross-functional impact or those affecting baselines will be escalated or channeled through the CCB as appropriate. [Consider adding a note on resolving technical disagreements among leads if they cannot reach consensus, e.g., escalation to PM or a designated technical authority.]
*   **Risk-Based Decisions:** Decisions related to risk treatment and mitigation will be guided by the Risk Management Plan.

## 4. Project Lifecycle and Phases

### 4.1. Overview of gRiTOS Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)
The gRiTOS Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) encompasses the entire lifespan of the product, from initial idea to eventual retirement. It is structured into distinct phases, as summarized from Section 2.1 of the [`../gritos_development_plan.md`](../../plan/gritos_development_plan.md).

## 5. Core Project Management Processes
This section outlines the core project management processes employed within the gRiTOS project. Each subsection provides a brief overview of the process area and references the specific, detailed management plan document that governs that area. These detailed plans contain the full procedures, roles, and responsibilities for their respective domains.

### 5.1. Scope Management
Scope management ensures that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully. This involves processes for scope planning, requirements collection, scope definition (including the creation of a Work Breakdown Structure - WBS), scope verification, and scope control.
The detailed processes and procedures for managing the gRiTOS project scope are defined in the [`./scope_management_plan.md`](./scope_management_plan.md). This plan elaborates on defining the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), establishing clear project boundaries, and managing scope creep through formal change requests. Changes to scope are governed by the [`./change_management_process.md`](./change_management_process.md).

### 5.2. Schedule Management
Schedule management involves defining project activities, sequencing them, estimating their durations, allocating resources, and developing and controlling the project schedule. This ensures that the project is completed in a timely manner.
The detailed processes for activity definition, sequencing, duration estimating, schedule development, and schedule control are defined in the [`./schedule_management_plan.md`](./schedule_management_plan.md). Key activities involve activity definition based on the WBS, sequencing tasks, estimating durations and resources, and employing critical path analysis to monitor progress against approved schedule baselines.

### 5.3. Cost Management
Cost management for the gRiTOS project primarily focuses on managing personnel effort and significant resource utilization, rather than detailed financial tracking, unless specified for particular sub-projects or procurements. This includes processes for effort estimating, budget (effort) determination, and cost (effort) control.
The detailed processes for managing project costs (primarily effort) are defined in the [`./cost_management_plan.md`](./cost_management_plan.md). Should significant financial expenditures be required (e.g., for specialized hardware, software licenses, or external contractor services), these will be subject to approval by the Project Sponsor based on a formal procurement request.

### 5.4. Quality Management
Quality management ensures that the gRiTOS project and its deliverables meet the required quality standards and stakeholder expectations. This involves quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control activities.
All aspects of quality planning, assurance, and control for the gRiTOS project are extensively detailed in the [`./quality_management_plan.md`](./quality_management_plan.md). This encompasses establishing quality objectives, performing quality assurance activities like process audits and formal reviews (e.g., Fagan inspections or similar), and implementing quality control measures such as systematic testing and rigorous defect tracking and resolution. This document covers applicable standards, methodologies for reviews and audits, testing strategies, defect tracking and resolution procedures, and quality metrics.

### 5.5. Resource Management
Resource management involves planning, acquiring, developing, managing, and controlling all types of project resources, including human resources (team members with specific skills), hardware resources (development boards, test equipment), and software resources (toolchains, IDEs).
The detailed processes for resource planning, acquisition, development and management, and control are defined in the [`./resource_management_plan.md`](./resource_management_plan.md). This includes identifying necessary roles and skills, acquiring and allocating team members, and planning for the timely availability of necessary hardware and software tools.

### 5.6. Risk Management
Risk management is a proactive process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating, treating, and monitoring risks throughout the project lifecycle. This includes technical, project, safety, and security risks.
The comprehensive processes for risk identification, analysis, response planning, and monitoring and control are defined in the [`./risk_management_plan.md`](./risk_management_plan.md). Key elements involve maintaining a risk register, conducting regular risk reviews, and implementing mitigation strategies for high-priority risks.

### 5.7. Configuration Management
Configuration Management (CM) is critical for ensuring the integrity, consistency, and traceability of all project artifacts, including code, documentation, and tools, throughout the project lifecycle.
The detailed methods and procedures for configuration identification, control, status accounting, and audits are specified in the [`./configuration_management_plan.md`](./configuration_management_plan.md) (SCMP). This includes defining configuration items (CIs), establishing baselines, managing changes to those baselines, and performing configuration audits.

### 5.8. Change Management
Change management provides a structured approach to managing all changes to baselined project artifacts, ensuring that changes are properly requested, evaluated, approved, implemented, and verified.
The formal procedures for initiating, evaluating, approving, implementing, and verifying changes are detailed in the [`./change_management_process.md`](./change_management_process.md). This process involves a Change Control Board (CCB) to assess the impact of proposed changes on scope, schedule, cost, and quality before approval.

### 5.9. Requirements Management
Requirements management focuses on eliciting, defining, analyzing, tracing, validating, verifying, and managing changes to project and product requirements. The project adopts a "Docs as Code" philosophy where feasible. This means that key documentation, particularly technical specifications and management plans, are written in plain text formats like Markdown, version-controlled in Git alongside source code, and reviewed using collaborative processes such as pull/merge requests.
The detailed processes for requirements management are described in the [`./requirements_management_plan.md`](./requirements_management_plan.md). This includes establishing traceability between requirements, design, code, and tests.

### 5.10. Documentation Management
Documentation management ensures that all project and product documentation is planned, created, reviewed, approved, stored, and controlled effectively. This includes managing the flow and maturity of documents through the project lifecycle.
The specific procedures for documentation planning, creation, review, approval, storage, control, and development flow are governed by the [`./documentation_plan.md`](./documentation_plan.md). Additional details on documentation flow and maturity are also discussed in section 5.10.4 of this PMP.

#### 5.10.4. Documentation Development Flow and Maturity
The gRiTOS project employs a layered approach to documentation development, ensuring that foundational processes are stable while allowing project-specific documentation to evolve with the project's lifecycle.

*   **Foundational Framework Documents:** The `*_management_plan.md` documents located in the `./` directory (e.g., this PMP, Quality Management Plan, Configuration Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc.) constitute the foundational framework for project governance and core processes. These documents are intended to be relatively stable. However, they are living documents and can be updated via the formal Change Management Process if significant changes to project governance structures or core operational processes are deemed necessary.

*   **Phase-Specific Project Documents:** As the project progresses through its PLM Phases (detailed in Section 4 of this PMP and the [`../gritos_development_plan.md`](../../plan/gritos_development_plan.md)), more specific project plans and documents will be generated. These typically take the form of `*_plan.md` for detailed activities (e.g., `Test Plan.md`) or specific reports, specifications, and analyses (e.g., `Detailed Design Specification.md`, `Safety Analysis Report.md`). These documents elaborate on the execution of activities planned for each phase and capture the results and evidence from those activities.

*   **Defining Document Requirements and Maturity for Phase Gates:** The specific set of documents required to be completed, their expected content detail, and the necessary maturity level for these documents to successfully pass a phase gate review are defined and guided by several key reference documents:
    *   The [`./documentation_plan.md`](./documentation_plan.md) provides the overall strategy, lists key document types, and outlines general expectations for documentation across the project lifecycle.
    *   The [`./quality_management_plan.md`](./quality_management_plan.md) defines the quality criteria for all project documentation, including processes for review, audit, and approval, ensuring documents meet the required standards before phase progression.
    *   Project-specific Safety and Cybersecurity plans (which may be referenced in the QMP or exist as standalone documents like a Safety Case outline or Security Plan) will specify the particular safety and security analyses, reports, and evidence documentation required at each stage.
    *   Compliance Artifact Management Plans or checklists [To be developed/specified, e.g., listing artifacts like Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) reports, Safety Cases, Cybersecurity Assurance Level (CAL) determination documents for relevant standards like ISO 26262 or ISO/SAE 21434] will further detail the specific artifacts, records, and documentation evidence required to demonstrate compliance with applicable industry standards (e.g., ISO 26262) or regulatory requirements.

This layered approach ensures that overarching governance and processes remain consistent and controlled, while detailed project and product documentation is developed iteratively, aligned with the progress of the project and the specific needs of each lifecycle phase.

### 5.11. Procurement Management
Procurement management involves processes for acquiring goods, services, or results from outside the project team, should this be necessary. This includes planning procurements, selecting suppliers, administering contracts, and closing procurements.
The detailed processes for procurement management are defined in the [`./procurement_management_plan.md`](./procurement_management_plan.md). This covers aspects like developing statements of work (SOW), criteria for supplier selection, and managing contractual agreements.

### 5.12. Communications Management
Effective communications management is essential for ensuring timely and appropriate planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, monitoring, and ultimate disposition of project information.
Detailed processes for communications planning, information distribution, and monitoring communication effectiveness are defined in the [`./communications_management_plan.md`](./communications_management_plan.md). This plan outlines the communication matrix, including types of information, frequency, channels, and audiences for project communications.

### 5.13. Stakeholder Management
Stakeholder management involves identifying project stakeholders, analyzing their expectations and influence, and developing appropriate strategies to engage them effectively to ensure their support and minimize resistance.
Detailed processes for stakeholder identification, analysis, engagement planning, and managing stakeholder engagement are defined in the [`./stakeholder_management_plan.md`](./stakeholder_management_plan.md). This includes creating a stakeholder register, assessing their impact and influence, and planning specific engagement strategies to foster support and address concerns.

### 5.14. Safety Management
Safety management is critical for gRiTOS, ensuring that functional safety is systematically managed in line with standards like ISO 26262. This involves safety planning, hazard identification and analysis, safety requirements specification, and safety verification and validation.
Detailed processes for safety management are defined in the [`./safety_management_plan.md`](./safety_management_plan.md). This plan outlines activities such as conducting Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessments (HARA) and developing Safety Cases. The interplay between safety and security measures will be carefully managed, recognizing that requirements in one area can impact the other.

### 5.15. Security Management
Security management is crucial for gRiTOS, ensuring that cybersecurity is systematically managed in line with relevant standards and best practices. This involves security planning, threat modeling and risk assessment, security requirements specification, and security verification and validation.
Detailed processes for security management are defined in the [`./security_management_plan.md`](./security_management_plan.md). This plan details activities like Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) and defining cybersecurity goals and claims. Coordination with Safety Management processes is essential to ensure a holistic approach to system dependability.

### 5.16. Compliance Artifact Management
Compliance artifact management involves identifying, generating, collecting, reviewing, approving, storing, and managing the work products and evidence required to demonstrate compliance with specified standards (e.g., ISO 26262, ASPICE).
Detailed processes for compliance artifact management are defined in the [`./compliance_artifact_management_plan.md`](./compliance_artifact_management_plan.md). This includes ensuring all necessary evidence is gathered, correctly formatted, and linked to relevant requirements and standards. [Consideration should be given to specific tooling for managing compliance artifacts and their traceability, such as features within requirements management tools or dedicated compliance management software, if appropriate for project scale and complexity.]

## 6. Project Management Process Integration

### 6.1. Interrelation of Processes
The core project management processes described in Section 5 are highly interrelated and do not operate in isolation. For example:
*   **Scope Management** defines what needs to be done, providing a basis for Schedule, Cost, and Resource Management.
*   **Requirements Management** provides the detailed foundation for the scope and is critical for Quality Management (verification and validation).
*   **Risk Management** identifies potential issues that can affect any other process, leading to updates in plans (e.g., schedule buffers, alternative resource plans).
*   **Change Management** provides a controlled way to modify baselines established by Scope, Schedule, Configuration, and Requirements Management. Approved changes often trigger updates in multiple areas.
*   **Configuration Management** ensures the integrity of all project artifacts, which is essential for quality, change management, and traceability.
*   **Quality Management** processes interact with all development and management activities to ensure standards are met and deliverables are fit for purpose.
*   **Communication Management** facilitates the interactions between all processes and stakeholders.
*   **Safety and Security Management** are integrated into all relevant processes, from requirements to design, implementation, testing, and ongoing management.

Effective project management relies on the seamless interaction and consistent application of these processes.

### 6.2. Tailoring of Processes
While this PMP and its subsidiary plans define the standard project management framework for gRiTOS, some tailoring may be necessary for specific sub-projects, components, or development activities (e.g., Agile sub-efforts vs. V-model driven hardware development).
    The principles and guidelines for tailoring development methodologies and their associated project management processes are described in the [`../process/development_methodology_tailoring_guide.md`](../process/development_methodology_tailoring_guide.md). Any significant tailoring of project management processes will be documented and approved by the Project Manager.

### 6.3. Continuous Improvement
The project management processes themselves are subject to continuous improvement. Periodically, and particularly at the end of major project phases or as part of lessons learned activities, the effectiveness of these processes will be reviewed. Feedback from the project team and stakeholders will be solicited to identify areas for improvement. The Project Manager, in consultation with the Quality Assurance (QA) Lead and other relevant leads, is responsible for initiating these periodic reviews and for championing the implementation of approved process improvements.
This feedback can lead to updates to this PMP, its subsidiary management plans, or associated procedures and templates, aiming to enhance project efficiency, quality, and stakeholder satisfaction in future project phases or similar projects.
