# Risk Management Plan (RMP) for gRiTOS

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This Risk Management Plan (RMP) establishes the framework, processes, and responsibilities for identifying, analyzing, evaluating, treating, monitoring, and communicating risks associated with the gRiTOS project. The goal is to proactively manage risks to minimize their potential adverse impact on project objectives, including technical performance, schedule, cost, safety, and security.

### 1.2. Scope
This RMP applies to all aspects and phases of the gRiTOS project. It encompasses project-level risks (e.g., resource, schedule, external dependencies) and technical risks (e.g., design flaws, technology immaturity, integration challenges). It complements, and provides an overarching framework for, specific safety hazard analyses (FMEA, FTA, HAZOP) and security threat analyses (TARA) which are detailed in their respective documents/activities but whose outputs are inputs to this plan.

### 1.3. Audience
- Entire project team (all engineering disciplines)
- Project Management
- Change Control Board (CCB)
- Stakeholders

### 1.5. Definitions and Acronyms
- **Risk:** An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.
- **Likelihood:** The probability or chance of a risk occurring.
- **Impact:** The consequence or effect of a risk if it occurs (e.g., on schedule, cost, technical performance, safety, security).
- **Severity (Risk Level):** The overall threat posed by a risk, often calculated as a function of likelihood and impact.
- **Risk Appetite:** The amount and type of risk that an organization is willing to pursue or retain.
- **Risk Tolerance:** The degree, amount, or volume of risk that an organization or individual will withstand.
- **Risk Register:** A document or database that logs all identified risks and their associated details.
- **Risk Treatment:** The process of selecting and implementing measures to modify risk. Common strategies include:
    - **Mitigation (Reduce):** Action taken to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk.
    - **Avoidance (Terminate):** Action taken to eliminate the threat or protect project objectives from its impact.
    - **Transfer:** Action taken to shift some or all of the negative impact of a threat, along with ownership of the response, to a third party.
    - **Acceptance (Tolerate):** Acknowledging a risk and not taking action unless the risk occurs (passive acceptance) or developing a contingency plan (active acceptance).
- **Contingency Plan:** A plan designed to take account of a possible future event or circumstance; a fallback plan.
- **Risk Owner:** The person or entity with the accountability and authority to manage a risk.

## 3. Risk Management Process

### 3.1. Risk Management Planning
- This initial step (largely covered by this RMP document itself) involves:
    - Defining the methodology, tools, and data sources for risk management.
    - Defining roles and responsibilities.
    - Establishing scales for likelihood and impact (e.g., qualitative scales like Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High; or quantitative scales if applicable).
    - Creating a Risk Matrix to define severity levels based on likelihood and impact.
    - Defining risk tolerance thresholds for the project (e.g., what level of risk is acceptable, requires active management, or is unacceptable).
    - Defining reporting formats and frequency.

### 3.2. Risk Identification
- **Techniques:**
    - Brainstorming sessions (involving cross-functional engineering teams and other stakeholders).
    - Checklists based on common software/OS development risks, gRiTOS-specific concerns (safety, security, real-time), and lessons learned.
    - Assumption and constraint analysis.
    - Expert interviews / Delphi technique.
    - Outputs from FMEA, FTA, HAZOP (for safety risks) and TARA (for security risks) serve as direct inputs.
    - Review of project documents (requirements, architecture, design).
- **Frequency:** Risk identification is an ongoing process. Formal risk identification workshops will be held at the beginning of each major PLM phase and reviewed at key project milestones.
- **Output:** All identified risks are logged in the Risk Register.

### 3.3. Risk Analysis
- **Qualitative Analysis:**
    - For each risk, assess its Likelihood of occurrence and potential Impact on project objectives (e.g., technical, schedule, cost, quality, safety, security).
    - Use the defined scales and Risk Matrix to determine the overall Risk Severity (or Level).
- **Quantitative Analysis (for selected high-severity risks):**
    - If more precise data is needed and available, quantitative techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation for schedule/cost impact, probabilistic risk assessment for technical failures) may be used. This requires more specialized engineering input.
- **Output:** Prioritized list of risks in the Risk Register, with likelihood, impact, and severity documented.

### 3.4. Risk Evaluation
- Compare the analyzed risk severity levels against the project's predefined risk tolerance thresholds.
- Determine which risks require active treatment and the urgency of that treatment.

### 3.5. Risk Treatment
- For each risk requiring treatment, a specific strategy is selected:
    - **Treat (Mitigate/Reduce):** Define and implement actions to reduce the likelihood or impact.
        - *Engineering Examples:* Adopting dual-source for critical hardware components, designing fault-tolerant software modules, extensive prototyping for new technologies, adding automated tests for high-risk areas, implementing robust error detection and recovery mechanisms, cross-training key engineering personnel.
    - **Terminate (Avoid):** Change project plans to eliminate the risk.
        - *Engineering Examples:* Descoping a feature that relies on unproven technology, selecting a different, more mature architectural approach, replacing a problematic COTS component.
    - **Transfer:** Shift the risk to a third party.
        - *Engineering Examples:* Using a certified third-party library for a specific function instead of developing it in-house (transfers development and some V&V risk), ensuring strong vendor support and warranties for critical hardware/tools.
    - **Tolerate (Accept):**
        - *Active Acceptance:* Acknowledge the risk and develop a Contingency Plan to be executed if the risk occurs.
        - *Passive Acceptance:* Acknowledge the risk and decide to take no action (only for low-severity risks where treatment cost outweighs potential impact, and with documented justification).
- **Risk Treatment Plan:** For each risk being actively treated, a plan is developed specifying:
    - Chosen treatment strategy.
    - Specific actions to be taken.
    - Risk Owner (responsible for overseeing treatment).
    - Action Owner(s) (responsible for implementing actions).
    - Due dates for actions.
    - Required resources.
    - Expected residual risk level after treatment.
- **Contingency Plan:** For significant risks (especially those actively accepted or where mitigation may not be fully effective), a fallback plan is developed.
    - *Engineering Examples:* Identifying alternative hardware suppliers, having a simplified backup algorithm if a complex one fails performance targets, allocating buffer time in the schedule for high-risk tasks.

### 3.6. Risk Monitoring and Control
- **Ongoing Activity:** The Risk Register is a living document.
- **Risk Owners** are responsible for monitoring their assigned risks, the progress of treatment actions, and the effectiveness of those actions.
- **Regular Reviews:** Risks are reviewed in project team meetings, CCB meetings (especially if changes are risk-driven or impact risks), and at PLM phase gate reviews.
- **New Risk Identification:** Continue to identify new risks as the project progresses.
- **Re-assessment:** Periodically re-assess likelihood, impact, and severity of existing risks as new information becomes available or as mitigation actions are implemented.
- **Trigger Conditions:** Define conditions that might trigger a risk re-assessment or activation of a contingency plan.

### 3.7. Risk Communication
- Risk information, including the Risk Register and status of key risks, will be communicated to relevant stakeholders through regular project reports, meetings, and dashboards.
- Engineering teams will be made aware of technical risks relevant to their work.

## 4. Risk Register
### 4.1. Purpose and Structure
