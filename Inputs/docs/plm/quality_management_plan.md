- **Internal Standards:** Project-specific coding standards (Rust), design guidelines, documentation templates, and defined processes (CM, ChM, Risk Mgt).

### 3.2. Quality Goals
- Achieve target ASIL/SIL levels for designated safety-critical components of gRiTOS.
- Meet or exceed defined cybersecurity assurance levels (CAL).
- Target defect density: [Specify target, e.g., < X defects/KLOC for critical modules post-release].
- Unit test coverage: [Specify target, e.g., >95% statement coverage for critical modules].
- System reliability: [Specify target, e.g., MTBF, availability].
- Performance: Meet defined real-time deadlines and resource usage targets.
- Successful completion of all planned V&V activities with no outstanding critical defects at release.

### 3.3. Key Quality Metrics (Engineering Focus)
- **Process Metrics:**
    - Review Effectiveness: (e.g., Number of major defects found per review hour).
    - Audit Compliance: Number of major/minor non-conformances found per process audit.
    - Schedule Adherence for QA Milestones.
- **Product Metrics (Software Engineering):**
    - Static Analysis: Number and severity of warnings (e.g., from Clippy, specialized Rust linters).
    - Code Complexity: Cyclomatic complexity of modules.
    - Test Coverage: Unit, integration, and system test coverage (statement, branch, MC/DC if applicable for safety).
    - Defect Metrics: Defect density (e.g., defects per KLOC or per component), defect detection rate per phase, defect leakage (defects found in later phases or by users), defect severity distribution, average time to fix critical defects.
    - Requirements Traceability: Percentage of requirements covered by tests.
    - Build Success Rate (CI/CD).
- **Safety/Security Metrics:**
    - Number of safety requirements verified and validated.
    - Number of security vulnerabilities identified (e.g., via fuzz testing, penetration testing) and remediated.
    - Status of hazard mitigations.

### 3.4. Data Collection, Analysis, and Reporting
Quality metrics will be collected from various sources including version control systems, build logs, static analysis tools, test execution reports, defect tracking systems, and review records. The QA Lead will be responsible for periodically analyzing this data, identifying trends, reporting on quality status to project management and engineering teams, and recommending corrective/preventive actions.

## 4. Quality Assurance (QA) Activities - Process Focus

### 4.1. Process Definition and Improvement
- QA will ensure all project processes (development, testing, CM, ChM, risk management, documentation) are clearly defined, documented, and communicated.
- Regular process audits will be conducted to ensure adherence and identify areas for improvement.
- Lessons learned sessions and retrospectives will feed into process improvement activities.

### 4.2. Technical Reviews and Audits (Engineering Artifacts)
- **Formal Technical Reviews (FTRs):** FTRs (e.g., inspections, walkthroughs) will be conducted for key engineering artifacts including:
    - Requirements Specifications (System, Software, Safety, Security)
    - Architecture Documents (System, Software)
    - Detailed Design Specifications
    - Test Plans, Test Cases, and Test Procedures
    - Safety Case and Security Assessment Reports
    - Risk Assessment documentation
- **Code Reviews:** All committed code must undergo peer review before merging into main development branches. Reviews will check for adherence to coding standards, design correctness, maintainability, and potential defects.
- **Process for Reviews:** Defined roles (Author, Moderator, Reviewer(s), Scribe), entry/exit criteria for reviews, checklists, and record-keeping procedures will be established.

### 4.3. Supplier Quality Assurance (if applicable)
If third-party software components (e.g., libraries, tools) or hardware are used, a process will be established to evaluate their quality, including assessing supplier documentation, test reports, certifications, and known issues. Engineering will be involved in the technical evaluation.

### 4.4. Tool Qualification (for safety-critical development)
Development and verification tools whose output could introduce or fail to detect errors in safety-critical components (e.g., compilers, static analyzers used for credit, test execution frameworks) must be qualified according to ISO 26262 Part 8, Clause 11. This involves creating a Tool Qualification Plan, documenting the tool's operational requirements, validation procedures, and known errata. Engineering teams will support this by providing usage context.

### 4.5. Training and Competency Management
QA will work with engineering leads to ensure that all personnel are adequately trained on the gRiTOS quality system, relevant standards (ISO 26262, coding standards, etc.), tools, and specific engineering processes. Competency records may be maintained.

## 5. Quality Control (QC) Activities - Product Focus

### 5.1. Testing and Verification/Validation (V&V)
All software and hardware components will undergo rigorous V&V activities as defined in the `../process/Development Model Overview.md` (V-Model and Agile approaches) and detailed in specific test plans (Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance). This includes:
- Functional testing against requirements.
- Performance testing against defined benchmarks.
- Reliability and endurance testing.
- Safety-specific testing (e.g., fault injection, testing of safety mechanisms).
- Security-specific testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning).
Engineering teams are responsible for executing unit and integration tests. Dedicated test teams or QA will be responsible for system and acceptance testing.

### 5.2. Defect Management
- A formal defect management process will be implemented using the project's designated defect tracking system.
- **Lifecycle:** Defect Reporting (with sufficient detail for reproduction), Analysis & Assignment (by engineering leads/QA), Prioritization (based on severity and impact), Resolution (by developers), Verification of Fix (by testers/QA), Closure.
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA):** For critical or recurring defects, RCA will be performed to identify underlying process or technical issues and implement corrective/preventive actions.

### 5.3. Non-Conformance Management
A process for identifying, documenting, evaluating, segregating (if applicable), and disposing of (e.g., rework, repair, scrap, use-as-is with concession) non-conforming products or process outputs will be defined. Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) will be implemented to address the root causes of non-conformances.

## 6. QMP Maintenance
This Quality Management Plan will be a living document. It will be reviewed at major project milestones, in response to audit findings, or when significant changes to project scope, standards, or processes occur. Updates will be managed via the project's Change Management Process.
