# Security Management Plan

## 1. Introduction
    1.1. Purpose of this Document
    This Security Management Plan outlines the processes, activities, and responsibilities required to ensure that cybersecurity is systematically managed throughout the gRiTOS project lifecycle. It provides the framework for achieving and demonstrating the required level of security for the gRiTOS product, considering relevant standards and best practices (e.g., concepts from ISO/SAE 21434).

    1.2. Scope of this Plan
    This plan applies to all security-related activities undertaken during the gRiTOS project, from concept to decommissioning. It covers the management of cybersecurity, including planning, threat modeling, risk assessment, derivation of security requirements, secure design and development practices, security verification and validation (testing), and incident response planning.
    This plan is an integral part of the overall Project Management Plan and is tightly integrated with other key plans such as the Quality Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, and development plans.

## 5. Summary and Document Maintenance
    5.1. Summary of Key Principles
    *   Security is managed proactively and integrated throughout the project lifecycle ("security by design").
    *   A systematic approach is taken to threat modeling, risk assessment, and the definition of security requirements.
    *   Security requirements are rigorously verified and validated.
    *   Documentation provides evidence of due diligence in security engineering.
    *   Security activities are integrated with overall project management, quality management, and risk management.
