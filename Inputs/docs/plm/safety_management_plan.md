# Safety Management Plan

## 1. Introduction
    1.1. Purpose of this Document
    This Safety Management Plan outlines the processes, activities, and responsibilities required to ensure that functional safety is systematically managed throughout the gRiTOS project lifecycle. It provides the framework for achieving and demonstrating the required level of safety for the gRiTOS product, in line with applicable standards such as ISO 26262.

    1.2. Scope of this Plan
    This plan applies to all safety-related activities undertaken during the gRiTOS project, from concept to decommissioning. It covers the management of functional safety, including planning, hazard identification, risk assessment, derivation of safety requirements, design for safety, safety verification and validation, and the creation of a safety case.
    This plan is an integral part of the overall Project Management Plan and is tightly integrated with other key plans such as the Quality Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, and development plans.
