## 2. Overview of the gRiTOS V-Model Implementation
The gRiTOS V-Model emphasizes a systematic approach where each phase of specification (left side of the V) is coupled with a corresponding verification or validation phase (right side of the V). All activities and deliverables are subject to the project's core PLM processes (CM, ChM, QM, Documentation, Risk Management).

## 6. Tailoring the V-Model for gRiTOS Components
While this guide describes the comprehensive V-Model application, certain gRiTOS components, based on their criticality and complexity, might undergo a tailored V-Model process.
*Reference: See `./Development Methodology Tailoring Guide.md` for guidelines on adapting V-Model activities while maintaining essential rigor.*
