# gRiTOS Development Model Overview

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the hybrid development methodology adopted for the gRiTOS project. It details how the V-Model and Agile practices are combined to ensure both rigor for safety-critical aspects and flexibility for iterative component development, guiding all engineering and project management activities.

### 1.2. Scope
This overview applies to all software and system development activities within the gRiTOS project, outlining the overarching framework and the integration points for different methodological approaches used by engineering teams.

### 1.3. Audience
- All gRiTOS project personnel, particularly engineering teams (architects, developers, testers, safety/security engineers), project managers, QA personnel.

### 1.4. Guiding Principles for the Hybrid Model
- Prioritize safety and security through structured Verification & Validation (V&V) as defined by the V-Model.
- Enable iterative development and rapid feedback for specific components or sub-efforts using Agile practices.
- Maintain clear, well-defined, and version-controlled interfaces between all components, regardless of the methodology used for their development.
- Ensure robust integration strategies for components developed via different methodologies.
- Apply core Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) processes consistently across all development work, including Configuration Management, Change Management, Quality Management, and Documentation Management.
- Empower engineering teams with appropriate methodological choices for specific contexts, within the guidelines set forth in this document and the `Development Methodology Tailoring Guide.md`.

## 2. The gRiTOS Hybrid Development Model Framework

### 2.1. Foundation: The V-Model
The V-Model serves as the primary, high-level framework for the gRiTOS project. It dictates the major development phases, the corresponding verification and validation activities for each level of specification, and ensures a systematic approach to achieving safety and quality objectives, particularly as required by standards like ISO 26262 for safety-critical elements. The V-Model emphasizes:
- **Decomposition and Definition (Left Side):** Progressing from concept of operations and stakeholder requirements through system requirements, system architecture, software/hardware architecture, to detailed design of components.
- **Integration and Qualification (Right Side):** Progressing from unit testing, component integration testing, sub-system integration testing, system verification testing, to final system validation (acceptance testing).
- **Direct Linkage:** Each phase on the left side has a corresponding V&V phase on the right side (e.g., detailed design is verified by unit testing; system architecture is verified by integration testing).

### 2.2. Incorporation of Agile Sub-Efforts
Within the V-Model's overall structure, particularly during the detailed design, implementation, and unit/component integration testing stages (i.e., the lower parts of the V-Model), specific components, modules, or well-defined work packages may be developed by engineering teams using Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban).
This approach is chosen to:
- Increase flexibility for components where requirements might evolve or are initially less certain.
- Allow for faster iteration cycles and earlier feedback on specific functionalities.
- Facilitate rapid prototyping and risk reduction for novel or complex parts of the system.
- Better manage development of non-safety-critical or auxiliary components that do not require the full V-Model rigor for every step.

### 2.3. Visual Representation
*(Placeholder for a diagram: A high-level V-Model diagram. Callouts on this diagram will indicate where Agile development cycles (sprints/iterations) for specific components or sub-systems can occur. These Agile cycles will show deliverables feeding into the V-Model's integration and testing stages at defined points.)*

## 3. Applying the V-Model in gRiTOS

### 3.1. Key V-Model Stages and Engineering Responsibilities
Engineering activities under the V-Model will produce specific, baselined deliverables (Configuration Items) at each stage, such as Requirements Specifications, Architecture Documents, Detailed Design Documents, Test Plans, and Test Reports. These are subject to formal reviews and configuration management as per the SCMP and QMP. The V-Model emphasizes traceability of requirements through design to code and tests.

### 3.2. Verification and Validation (V&V) Strategy
Each specification stage on the left side of the V has corresponding V&V activities on the right side, ensuring continuous quality checks. This includes reviews at each stage and testing appropriate for the level of abstraction.

*Reference: For comprehensive details on V-Model stages, activities, deliverables, and V&V processes specific to gRiTOS, refer to the `./v_model_process_guide.md`.*

## 4. Agile Sub-Efforts Implementation

### 4.1. Identifying Candidate Sub-Efforts for Agile
The decision to use Agile for a particular component or sub-effort will be guided by criteria outlined in the `./Development Methodology Tailoring Guide.md`. Key factors include component criticality (safety/security), requirements stability, interface definition clarity, and team experience.

### 4.2. Agile Practices for gRiTOS Engineering Teams
Agile teams will typically employ practices such as backlog management (using technical user stories or tasks), sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews (demonstrating working increments of software/hardware functionality), and sprint retrospectives. Technical practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD), Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), Continuous Integration (CI), and regular code refactoring are strongly encouraged.

### 4.3. Definition of Done (DoD) for Agile Increments
A stringent Definition of Done is critical for Agile increments. The DoD ensures that completed work is robust, thoroughly tested at the component level, documented to project standards, and ready for integration into the larger system being managed under the V-Model. The specific DoD will be tailored for each Agile sub-effort but must align with overall project quality requirements.

*Reference: For comprehensive details on implementing Agile practices, roles, backlog management, and Definition of Done for gRiTOS sub-efforts, refer to the `./Agile Sub-Efforts Guide.md`.*

## 5. Integration, Coordination, and Governance

### 5.1. Managing Interfaces
Clearly defined, documented, and version-controlled interfaces between components developed using different methodologies (or even different teams using the same methodology) are paramount for successful integration. Interface specifications are critical Configuration Items.

### 5.2. Synchronization and Deliverables
Outputs from Agile sprints (e.g., completed software components, test results, documentation updates) must be integrated into the main V-Model development stream at defined synchronization points. This typically occurs when Agile increments are ready for broader integration testing or contribute to a V-Model baseline. The timing and content of these deliverables must align with overall V-Model milestones and PLM phase gate reviews.

### 5.3. Adherence to Core PLM Processes
All development work, whether following a V-Model path or an Agile sub-effort, must adhere to the project's core PLM processes:
- Configuration Management (as per `../plm/Configuration Management Plan.md`)
- Change Management (as per `../plm/Change Management Process.md`)
- Quality Management (as per `../plm/Quality Management Plan.md`)
- Documentation Management (as per `../plm/Documentation Plan.md`)

## 6. Tailoring and Flexibility
While this document describes the primary hybrid model, specific tailoring of either the V-Model or Agile practices may be necessary for unique situations or specific components.

*Reference: All tailoring decisions must be justified, risk-assessed, documented, and approved as per the `./Development Methodology Tailoring Guide.md` and the project's Change Management Process.*

## 7. Document Maintenance
This Development Model Overview document will be reviewed at major project milestones or in response to significant process improvements or changes in project scope. Updates will be managed via the project's Change Management Process.
