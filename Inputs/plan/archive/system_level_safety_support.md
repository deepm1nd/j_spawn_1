# gRiTOS Support for System-Level Safety Integration

This document outlines guidance, processes, and deliverables provided by the gRiTOS project to support its integration into system-level safety-critical products, particularly those involving distributed safety development.

## 1. Overview of gRiTOS Safety Philosophy for Integrators

gRiTOS is developed as a safety-element-out-of-context (SEooC) with a "safety-first" approach (see Section 1.4.1 of the gRiTOS Product Specification). While gRiTOS provides core safety mechanisms and is built according to rigorous processes, the overall safety of the final system product rests with the system integrator.

The gRiTOS project commits to providing clear documentation, robust safety mechanisms, and configurable features that enable system integrators to:
*   Perform comprehensive system-level Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessments (HARA).
*   Conduct detailed Common Cause Failure (CCF) analyses.
*   Integrate gRiTOS as a reliable foundation for their safety functions.
*   Achieve safety certifications for their end products.

## 2. gRiTOS Safety Integration Package

To facilitate the use of gRiTOS in safety-critical system projects, the gRiTOS development plan includes the creation and maintenance of a **"gRiTOS Safety Integration Package."** This package will be a curated collection of deliverables specifically aimed at system integrators.

The package is planned to include:

*   **Core gRiTOS Binaries:** Verified and release-candidate versions of the microkernel and essential user-space services.
*   **Configuration Tools & Files:**
    *   Tools and Kconfig (or similar) files (Spec 5.2.6) necessary to configure gRiTOS features relevant to safety (e.g., partitioning, scheduling parameters, resource limits).
    *   Example component manifests (Spec 4.4) for safety-critical components.
*   **Safety Manual (or Key Excerpts):**
    *   Detailed "Assumptions of Use" for gRiTOS.
    *   Guidance on configuring and using gRiTOS safety mechanisms.
    *   Information on gRiTOS failure modes and error reporting.
    *   Evidence of gRiTOS development process compliance with relevant safety standards (e.g., IEC 61508, ISO 26262).
*   **Interface Specifications:**
    *   IDL files for all core gRiTOS services (Spec 4.4.5).
    *   API documentation for any safety-certified libraries.
*   **Verification and Validation Evidence (Summaries/Excerpts):**
    *   Summaries of test reports (unit, integration, system).
    *   Static analysis reports for critical components.
    *   WCET analysis reports for key kernel functions.
    *   Where applicable, summaries or certificates related to formal verification efforts.
*   **Traceability Information:** Documentation showing traceability from gRiTOS safety requirements to its design and V&V.
*   **Tooling Information:** List of qualified tools used in gRiTOS development and any associated qualification reports, if applicable for integrator use.

## 3. Supporting Distributed Safety Development

gRiTOS is well-suited for distributed safety architectures due to its microkernel design, strong isolation properties, and capability-based security. System integrators can leverage these features:

*   **Component Isolation:** Deploy independent safety functions as separate, isolated gRiTOS components. The gRiTOS kernel enforces spatial (memory) and temporal (scheduling) partitioning between these components, minimizing fault propagation.
*   **Secure Inter-Component Communication (IPC):** Utilize gRiTOS IPC mechanisms for reliable and access-controlled communication between distributed safety functions or components of different criticalities. Capabilities ensure that only authorized components can communicate.
*   **Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS):** Configure gRiTOS to host components of different SIL/ASIL levels on the same processor, with the OS providing mechanisms to ensure Freedom From Interference (FFI) (Spec 2.4.5, 3.5.2). Integrators are responsible for defining the partitioning scheme and validating its effectiveness for their specific use case.
*   **Health Monitoring and Fault Management:** System integrators can build distributed health monitoring and fault management applications on gRiTOS, leveraging OS-level error detection and reporting features (Spec 2.4.3, 2.4.4).

## 4. Guidance for System-Level HARA

System integrators should use the information provided in the gRiTOS Product Specification and the gRiTOS Safety Integration Package (particularly the Safety Manual) to:

*   **Understand gRiTOS Failure Modes:** The documented failure modes of gRiTOS services and the kernel help in identifying potential contributions to system-level hazards in the integrator's FMEA/FTA.
*   **Leverage gRiTOS Safety Mechanisms:** Account for gRiTOS's fault containment, error detection, and recovery mechanisms in the system safety concept, taking note of their scope and limitations.
*   **Define FTTI/FDTI:** Use the predictable performance characteristics and error handling of gRiTOS as a basis for defining and meeting application-specific Fault Tolerant Time Intervals (FTTI) and Fault Detection Time Intervals (FDTI).
*   **Validate Assumptions:** The "Assumptions of Use" in the Safety Manual must be validated against the actual system design and operational context.

## 5. Guidance for System-Level CCF Analysis

The gRiTOS Safety Integration Package will provide information to support the integrator's CCF analysis:

*   **Identification of Shared Resources:** The Safety Manual will identify gRiTOS-managed resources that could be involved in CCFs (e.g., single kernel instance, specific HAL drivers, core services if not replicated by the integrator).
*   **Use of Partitioning:** Integrators should design their system architecture to utilize gRiTOS's spatial and temporal partitioning features as a primary defense against software CCFs between components.
*   **Hardware CCFs:** gRiTOS itself does not mitigate hardware CCFs (e.g., a single CPU failing). Integrators are responsible for hardware redundancy and diversity if required by their safety goals.
*   **Diversity Strategies:** For applications requiring very high integrity, integrators may implement diverse software components or diverse redundant systems; gRiTOS provides a platform for such architectures.

The gRiTOS project is committed to providing the necessary support and documentation to enable integrators to build safe and secure systems.
