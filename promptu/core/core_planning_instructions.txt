**I. USER-CONFIGURED PATHS, ADD-ON SELECTION, COMPONENT DISCOVERY & LOADING:**

A. **Extract User's High-Level Project Request:**
    1.  Initialize `User_High_Level_Project_Goal`: `null` (or an empty string).
    2.  Define delimiters: `start_req_delim = "[[USER_PROJECT_REQUEST]]"`, `end_req_delim = "[[END_USER_PROJECT_REQUEST]]"`.
    1.  Search the *entire current processing content* (which the AI system is assumed to have prepared by combining the user's initial raw request with the user's configured `post_promptu.txt` file loaded via a directive) for text between these delimiters.
    4.  If found:
        a.  Extract the raw string content (exclusive of the delimiters, trim leading/trailing whitespace).
        b.  Store this extracted content as `User_High_Level_Project_Goal`.
        c.  INFO "User High-Level Project Goal successfully extracted."
    5.  If not found OR if the extracted content is empty or only whitespace:
        a.  WARNING "[[USER_PROJECT_REQUEST]] block not found or empty. The primary project goal may be missing. Subsequent planning processes might rely on user input provided through other configuration means (e.g., within component-specific parameters) or may require clarification."
        b.  `User_High_Level_Project_Goal` remains `null` or is set to a specific "not_found_or_empty" marker string.
    6.  The `User_High_Level_Project_Goal` (or its not-found status) should be accessible by primary directive components (e.g., the component for a selected promptApp task, or a selected primary add-on like `task_spawning_addon` or `create_research_report`) for their main planning or processing context. These components will be responsible for checking if the goal is sufficiently defined for their needs.

B. **Parse User-Configured Paths for Outputs and Specific Inputs:**
    You **must** parse the `[[USER PATH CONFIGURATION]]` block if it is found at the very beginning of *this `post_promptu.txt`*. These paths are primarily for directing your outputs and locating some user-provided process-specific inputs.
    *   **Note:** This section is largely deprecated with the move to app-specific configurations and fixed system paths. However, if legacy path configurations are found, they might be used by older components. Modern components should rely on their own `user_..._config.txt` files for path parameters.
    *   If any output/process-specific paths are required by an active component and not found in its dedicated configuration, that component must define its own default behavior or error handling.
    *   All paths you generate for outputs must be constructed clearly, typically relative to the repository root.

C. **Fixed Global System Paths for Core Components:**
    The locations for core framework components (PromptApps, Add-ons, Utils, Base IEP, IPC directory) are fixed and relative to the repository root. You **must** use these hardcoded paths for discovery and loading:
    *   **PromptApps Base Directory:** `promptu/apps/`
    *   **Add-ons Base Directory:** `promptu/add_ons/`
    *   **Utils Base Directory:** `promptu/util/`
    *   **IEP Base Directory:** `promptu/core/` (specifically for `base_iep.txt`)
    *   **IPC Base Directory:** `promptu/ipc/` (for future IPC components and general IPC file storage)

D. **Discover and Load Add-on Components:**
    1.  **Parse User Add-on Selections:**
        a.  Scan the `[[USER_ADDON_SELECTION]]` block from `post_promptu.txt`.
        b.  Identify lines beginning with `[x]` to extract the selected `addon_app_name`s (these are folder names).
        c.  Compile an ordered list of these: `Selected_Addons_AppNames_Ordered`.
    2.  **Define Known Primary Directive Add-on Apps:**
        `Known_Primary_Directive_Addon_Apps`: A list of `addon_app_name`s recognized as primary directives (e.g., `["task_spawning_addon", "create_research_report"]`).
    3.  **Initialize Collections for Add-ons:**
        *   `Active_Primary_Addon_AppName`: null
        *   `All_Selected_Addons_Content_Map`: An empty map for `addon_app_name: primary_instruction_content`.
        *   `App_Specific_Configs_Content_Map`: An empty map for `component_name: raw_config_block_string`. (Note: This map is now generic for any component type, not just add-ons).
        *   `Inheritable_Addons_Content_Ordered_List`: An empty ordered list for content of selected non-primary add-ons.
        *   `Loaded_Primary_Addon_AppNames`: An empty list to track selected primary add-on apps that were successfully loaded.
    4.  **Load Selected Add-on Content & Discover App-Specific Configs:**
        For each `selected_app_name` in `Selected_Addons_AppNames_Ordered`:
        a.  Construct the path to its primary instruction file: `path_to_primary_instruction_file = promptu/add_ons/[selected_app_name]/[selected_app_name].txt`.
        b.  Attempt to read the content of this file.
        c.  If successfully read:
            i.  Store its content in `All_Selected_Addons_Content_Map` with `selected_app_name` as key.
            ii. If `selected_app_name` is in `Known_Primary_Directive_Addon_Apps`:
                *   Add `selected_app_name` to `Loaded_Primary_Addon_AppNames`.
                *   If `Active_Primary_Addon_AppName` is still null, set `Active_Primary_Addon_AppName = selected_app_name`.
            iii. **Scan Main Prompt for App-Specific Configuration Block:**
                *   Define delimiters: `start_delim = "[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_" + selected_app_name + "]]"`, `end_delim = "[[END_USER_CONFIG_FOR_" + selected_app_name + "]]"`.
                *   Search the *entire original user-provided main prompt file content* (typically `post_promptu.txt`) for text between these delimiters.
                *   If found, extract the raw string content and store it in `App_Specific_Configs_Content_Map` with `selected_app_name` as the key.
        d.  If the primary instruction file is not found or unreadable: Prepare a warning: "Warning: Selected add-on app '[selected_app_name]' is missing its primary instruction file at '[path_to_primary_instruction_file]' and will be skipped."
    5.  **Populate Inheritable Add-ons List:** (This logic will be primarily driven by promptApp context or if no promptApp is selected)
        For each `loaded_app_name` in `Selected_Addons_AppNames_Ordered` (iterate based on original selection order, but only consider apps successfully loaded):
        a.  If `loaded_app_name` is NOT equal to `Active_Primary_Addon_AppName` (and no promptApp is active, or if promptApp allows), add its content to `Inheritable_Addons_Content_Ordered_List`.
    6.  **Handle Multiple Selected Primary Add-ons:** If `Loaded_Primary_Addon_AppNames` contains more than one app name, prepare a warning.
    7.  The collections are used in Section II.

E. **Input Definition Files (base_iep.txt):**
    Loaded from `promptu/core/base_iep.txt`. (Referenced in Section III.C.1).

F. **Discover and Load Utility Components ("Utils"):**
    a.  Initialize `All_Available_Utils_Content_Map` (map for `util_app_name: content`).
    b.  Scan for all subdirectories within `promptu/util/`. For each `util_dir_name`:
        i.  Define `util_app_name = util_dir_name`.
        ii. Path to component: `path_to_util = promptu/util/[util_dir_name]/[util_dir_name].txt`.
        iii. Attempt to load content from `path_to_util`. If successful, store it in `All_Available_Utils_Content_Map` with `util_app_name` as key and mark this `util_app_name` as "loaded_from_subdir".
    c.  Scan for all `.txt` files directly within `promptu/util/` (e.g., `utility_name.txt`). For each `util_file_name.txt`:
        i.  Define `util_app_name = util_file_name` (without the .txt extension).
        ii. If `util_app_name` is already in `All_Available_Utils_Content_Map` (i.e., "loaded_from_subdir"), issue a warning: "Warning: Utility '[util_app_name]' found both as direct file `promptu/util/[util_file_name].txt` and in subdirectory `promptu/util/[util_app_name]/`. Prioritizing version from subdirectory. Please ensure uniqueness." and SKIP this file.
        iii. Else:
            *   Path to component: `path_to_util = promptu/util/[util_file_name].txt`.
            *   Attempt to load content from `path_to_util`. If successful, store it in `All_Available_Utils_Content_Map` with `util_app_name` as key.
    d.  For any util not loaded successfully (either type), issue appropriate warnings.
    e.  Utils are available for use by other components.

G. **Discover and Load PromptApp Manifests:**
    1.  Initialize `Available_PromptApps_Manifest_Map` (empty map for `promptAppName: manifest_object`).
    2.  Scan `promptu/apps/` for subdirectories. Each is a `promptAppName`.
    3.  For each `promptAppName`:
        a.  Path to manifest: `promptu/apps/[promptAppName]/[promptAppName]_manifest.json`.
        b.  Attempt to read and parse the JSON content of this file.
        c.  If successfully read and parsed:
            i.  Validate manifest structure (presence of `promptAppDisplayName`, `description`, `phases` array; phases have `phaseName`, `tasks` array; tasks have `taskName`, `description`, `componentName`, `isIterable`). Issue warnings for structural issues.
            ii. Store the valid manifest object in `Available_PromptApps_Manifest_Map` with `promptAppName` as key.
        d.  If manifest file is missing, unreadable, or JSON is invalid: Prepare a warning: "Warning: PromptApp '[promptAppName]' has a missing or invalid manifest at '[path_to_manifest]' and will be unavailable."

H. **Parse User PromptApp Selection & Configuration:**
    1.  Initialize `Selected_PromptAppName`: null.
    2.  Initialize `Selected_App_Tasks_Ordered`: empty list.
    3.  Scan `post_promptu.txt` for the `[[USER_APP_SELECTION]]` block.
    4.  Identify lines beginning with `[x]` to extract the selected `potential_app_name`.
    5.  If multiple promptApps are selected, issue a warning: "Warning: Multiple promptApps selected. Using the first one: '[first_selected_app_name]'." Set `Selected_PromptAppName` to the first valid one found in `Available_PromptApps_Manifest_Map`.
    6.  If only one `[x]` is found, set `Selected_PromptAppName` to that `potential_app_name`, provided it exists as a key in `Available_PromptApps_Manifest_Map`. If not found in the map, issue a warning and set `Selected_PromptAppName` to null.
    7.  If `Selected_PromptAppName` is set and valid:
        a.  Define delimiters for its configuration block: `start_config_delim = "[[USER_" + Selected_PromptAppName + "_CONFIGURATION]]"`, `end_config_delim = "[[END_USER_" + Selected_PromptAppName + "_CONFIGURATION]]"`.
        b.  Search the *entire original user-provided main prompt file content* (typically `post_promptu.txt`) for text between these delimiters.
        c.  If found:
            i.  Parse the content line by line.
            ii. Identify lines starting with `[x]` (case-insensitive for 'x') followed by a task name (e.g., `[x] My Task Name`). Extract "My Task Name".
            iii. Add each such extracted task name to `Selected_App_Tasks_Ordered`, maintaining the order from the block.
            iv. Store the raw string content of this block in `App_Specific_Configs_Content_Map` with `Selected_PromptAppName` as the key (for reference or audit).
        d.  If the configuration block is missing: Issue a warning: "Warning: PromptApp '[Selected_PromptAppName]' is selected, but its configuration block '[[USER_[Selected_PromptAppName]_CONFIGURATION]]' was not found. No tasks can be run." Set `Selected_PromptAppName` to null.
        e.  If the block is found but no tasks are checked `[x]`: Issue a warning: "Warning: PromptApp '[Selected_PromptAppName]' configuration block found, but no tasks were selected with '[x]'. No tasks will be run." Set `Selected_PromptAppName` to null.

I. **Parse User Framework Settings:**
    1.  Initialize `Framework_Full_Handoff_Notes_Enabled`: `false`.
    2.  Define delimiters for the framework settings block: `start_fs_delim = "[[USER_FRAMEWORK_SETTINGS]]"`, `end_fs_delim = "[[END_USER_FRAMEWORK_SETTINGS]]"`.
    3.  Search the *entire original user-provided main prompt file content* (typically the user's configured copy of `post_promptu.txt`) for text between these delimiters.
    4.  If the `[[USER_FRAMEWORK_SETTINGS]]` block is found:
        a.  Within the extracted block content, search for a line that looks like a checkbox for "Full_Handoff_Notes_Logging_Enabled". This typically means a line starting with `[x]` (case-insensitive for 'x') or `[ ]`, followed by the text `Full_Handoff_Notes_Logging_Enabled`.
        b.  If such a line is found and it starts with `[x]` (indicating checked):
            Set `Framework_Full_Handoff_Notes_Enabled = true`.
            INFO "Full_Handoff_Notes_Logging_Enabled is TRUE."
        c.  Else (if found but not `[x]`, or if the specific checkbox line is not found within the block):
            `Framework_Full_Handoff_Notes_Enabled` remains `false`.
            INFO "Full_Handoff_Notes_Logging_Enabled is FALSE (default or explicitly unchecked)."
    5.  Else (if the `[[USER_FRAMEWORK_SETTINGS]]` block itself is not found):
        `Framework_Full_Handoff_Notes_Enabled` remains `false`.
        INFO "[[USER_FRAMEWORK_SETTINGS]] block not found. Full_Handoff_Notes_Logging_Enabled is FALSE (default)."

**II. PRIMARY EXECUTION LOGIC (Revised for PromptApps):**

A. **Determine Execution Path (PromptApp or Add-on):**

    -1. **Initialize Handoff Notes Archive and Context:**
        a.  Define `handoff_notes_path = "framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes.md"`.
        b.  Define `handoff_archive_dir = "framework_dev_docs/meta/archive/"`.
        c.  Define `handoff_notes_archive_subdir = handoff_archive_dir + "handoff_notes/"`.
        d.  AI SHOULD: Check if `handoff_notes_path` exists in the workspace and contains content.
        e.  IF `handoff_notes_path` exists AND has content that appears to be from a *previous session* (e.g., it's not empty at the very beginning of a new session processing sequence):
            i.   INFO "Stale `handoff_notes.md` detected. Archiving previous session content."
            ii.  AI SHOULD: Read the entire content of `handoff_notes_path` into a variable `stale_notes_content`.
            iii. AI SHOULD: Generate a `session_date_time` marker string (e.g., based on current UTC timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format, or try to parse a timestamp from `stale_notes_content` if reliable).
            iv.  AI SHOULD: Ensure the directory `handoff_notes_archive_subdir` exists in the workspace. If not, create it. (This also implies creating `handoff_archive_dir` if it doesn't exist).
            v.   Define `archive_file_path = handoff_notes_archive_subdir + "handoff_notes_" + session_date_time + ".md"`.
            vi.  AI SHOULD: Create the new file `archive_file_path` in the workspace.
            vii. AI SHOULD: Write `stale_notes_content` into `archive_file_path`.
            viii.AI SHOULD: Modify `handoff_notes_path` in the workspace to make it empty.
            ix.  INFO "Successfully archived stale notes to " + `archive_file_path` + " and emptied " + `handoff_notes_path`.
        f.  ELSE (if `handoff_notes_path` does not exist or is already empty):
            i.   INFO "`handoff_notes.md` is clean or does not exist. No prior session archival needed from it."
        g.  AI SHOULD: Read all files from `handoff_notes_archive_subdir` (e.g., `framework_dev_docs/meta/archive/handoff_notes/*.*`) to load historical context. Store this consolidated historical context internally.
        h.  AI SHOULD: Read the current content of `handoff_notes_path` (which should now be empty if it was archived, or non-existent/empty if it started that way) to prepare for new entries for the *current* session.

    0.  **Determine Invocation Context and Handle Special Empty States:**
        *   Assume a variable `Invocation_Context` is available, set by the system to either 'PRE_PROMPTU' (if `pre_promptu.txt` is the entry point) or 'POST_PROMPTU' (if `post_promptu.txt` is the entry point). If unavailable, default to 'POST_PROMPTU' and issue a warning.
        *   Check `User_High_Level_Project_Goal` (from Section I.A), `Selected_PromptAppName` (from Section I.H), `Active_Primary_Addon_AppName` (from Section I.D), and `Inheritable_Addons_Content_Ordered_List` (from Section I.D).

HALT further framework processing and await user interaction.'
                *   RETURN (do not proceed to normal execution logic).
        *   **Scenario 2 (post_promptu with no request, no app, no add-ons):**

            ix.  **Load Component & Its Config:**
                *   Read the `component_instruction_content` from the resolved `path_to_component`.
                *   Determine `base_path_of_resolved_component` (e.g., `promptu/add_ons/[component_name_to_load]/` or `promptu/apps/[Selected_PromptAppName]/`).
                *   Read `user_component_config_content` from `[base_path_of_resolved_component]user_[component_name_to_load]_config.txt`. (Handle file not found gracefully for components that don't have one).
                *   Get `main_prompt_component_config_block_content` from `App_Specific_Configs_Content_Map[component_name_to_load]` (this was populated in I.D.4.c.iii if a `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_componentName]]` block exists in the main prompt).

            x.   **Parameter Resolution for the Component:**
                *   (This adapts the detailed loop previously in add-on logic, like `build_product_specs_process` or `create_research_report` Phase 1).
                *   The component's `user_..._config.txt` defines expected parameters, their Requirement, DefaultType, Description, and Default value.

                    1.  Value from `main_prompt_component_config_block_content` (parsed from `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_component_name_to_load]]`).
                    2.  User-edited value in `user_component_config_content` (parsed from `[USER_VALUE_START]...[USER_VALUE_END]`).

                    5.  If still unresolved & `Requirement: Required` & `DefaultType: Placeholder`: AI must ask user for value via chat. Update the on-disk `user_..._config.txt` and advise user to update their main prompt's `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_...]]` block.
                    6.  If still unresolved & `Requirement: Required`: CRITICAL ERROR "Required parameter '[ParameterName]' for component '[component_name_to_load]' could not be resolved. Halting." HALT.
                *   Store resolved parameters internally for the component's use.

            xi.  **Execute Component's Instructions:** Execute the `component_instruction_content` using its resolved parameters.

            xii. **Iteration Handling (if `current_task_info.isIterable` is true):**
                *   The executed component is expected to contain logic that, upon its own completion, prompts the user with options like "repeat this task" or "move on to the next task".
                *   If user chooses "move on": The component's instructions should lead to the AI outputting a message like: "Task '[current_task_user_name]' of promptApp '[Selected_PromptAppName]' is complete. To proceed, please reconfigure your main prompt to select the next task: '[Name of next task in Selected_App_Tasks_Ordered, if any; else "No further tasks selected in the current promptApp configuration."]' and then start a new AI session." Then the AI should HALT.
                *   (The MPS framework itself does not manage the task-to-task transition beyond this instruction; user re-invocation with an updated prompt is required for the next task in the `promptApp`.)

    2.  **ELSE (No PromptApp selected or no actionable tasks in it; fallback to Add-on logic):**
        a.  INFO "No active promptApp. Proceeding with add-on execution logic."
        b.  **Process Active Primary Add-on (if any):** (This is the existing Section II.A logic)
            i.  If `Active_Primary_Addon_AppName` (identified in I.D.4) is not null:
                *   Retrieve its primary instruction content from `All_Selected_Addons_Content_Map`.
                *   Retrieve its app-specific config string from `App_Specific_Configs_Content_Map[Active_Primary_Addon_AppName]`.
                *   Execute its instructions. The add-on parses its config string and uses `Inheritable_Addons_Content_Ordered_List`.
            ii. **Else (If `Active_Primary_Addon_AppName` IS NULL):** (This is the existing Section II.B logic)
                *   State no active primary add-on was selected/found.
                *   If `Inheritable_Addons_Content_Ordered_List` is not empty, state intent to process these. For each, retrieve its app-specific config string. Execute if self-executing; be cautious.
                *   Generate `information_exchange_protocol.md`.
                *   Conclude operations.

**III. OUTPUT GENERATION REQUIREMENTS (Core Utilities):**

C. **Supporting Documentation (Core Utilities):**
1.  **`information_exchange_protocol.md`:**
    *   (Condition for generation as before, typically if no primary add-on or promptApp task successfully runs to completion of a major process).
    *   Load from `promptu/core/base_iep.txt`.
    *   Create in 'promptu folder' (user-configured output path, or a default like `outputs/current_session_prompts/`).
    *   (Example filenames for other docs: `dev_plan.md`, `mps_usage_guide.md`)

**IV. FINAL INSTRUCTION TO PLANNING AI & SELF-CORRECTION (Core):**

**IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK GUIDELINES:**
As a Planning AI using this framework, you MUST adhere to the following operational guidelines:
- **File Operations Restriction:**
    - Jules instances ARE ALLOWED to perform **create, read, and modify** operations on files directly within their workspace when these operations are necessary to prepare for a commit. These workspace changes will be part of the commit submitted by Jules.
    - Jules instances MUST **AVOID** direct `copy` and `move` file system operations without explicit user approval for each instance of such an operation.
    - To achieve a `copy`-like effect (replicating content to a new location):
        1. Create a new file in the target location within the workspace.
        2. Read the full content of the source file.
        3. Write (paste) this content into the newly created file.
        4. Save the new file in the workspace.
    - To achieve a `move`-like effect (replicating content to a new location with the intent of removing the source):
        1. Follow the same 'create new, read source, write to new, save new' method as for `copy`.
        2. If the source file is then intended to be deleted, Jules MUST recommend this deletion to the user for their explicit confirmation and action. Direct deletion of files by Jules should also be avoided without user confirmation for each instance.
    - Adherence to these file operation guidelines is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring user oversight of repository modifications, even as Jules prepares content for commits.

A.  **(Placeholder for any pre-finalization general instructions)**

B. **Final Commit Message by Planning AI:**
    Adhere to IEP (from `promptu/core/base_iep.txt`).
    *   **IF `Selected_PromptAppName` was processed for a task:**
        *   Task-ID: `PROCESSED_PROMPT_APP_[Selected_PromptAppName]_TASK_[current_task_user_name]` (use the user-friendly task name).
        *   Notes:
            *   `Selected_PromptAppName`: [Selected_PromptAppName]
            *   `Task Processed`: [current_task_user_name]
            *   Component Used: [component_name_to_load]
            *   Warnings for multiple promptApp selections, missing/invalid manifests, missing promptApp config block, or no tasks checked.
            *   Note if the task was iterable and user was prompted to continue/halt for next task.
            *   Self-checks, confidence, etc.
    *   **ELSE (Add-on or core utility processing):**
        *   Task-ID: e.g., `PROCESSED_PRIMARY_ADDON_[Active_Primary_Addon_AppName]` or `CORE_UTILITY_PROCESSING_ONLY`.
        *   Notes:
            *   `Active_Primary_Addon_AppName` processed (if applicable).
            *   Warnings for multiple primary add-on selections, missing add-on/util files.
            *   Summary of other add-ons processed from `Inheritable_Addons_Content_Ordered_List`.
            *   Note if any selected add-on expected an app-specific config block but it was not found.
            *   Self-checks, confidence, etc.

C. **Update Handoff Notes (`framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes.md`):**
    0. **Archive Current Handoff Notes Before Appending New Summary:**
        a.  INFO "Preparing to archive handoff notes before appending current session summary."
        b.  Define `handoff_notes_path = "framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes.md"`.
        c.  Define `handoff_archive_dir = "framework_dev_docs/meta/archive/"`.
        d.  Define `handoff_notes_archive_subdir = handoff_archive_dir + "handoff_notes/"`.
        e.  AI SHOULD: Check if `handoff_notes_path` exists in the workspace and contains content.
        f.  IF `handoff_notes_path` exists AND has content:
            i.   AI SHOULD: Read the entire content of `handoff_notes_path` into a variable `current_notes_content`.
            ii.  AI SHOULD: Generate a `current_session_date_time` marker string (e.g., based on current UTC timestamp in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format).
            iii. AI SHOULD: Ensure the directory `handoff_notes_archive_subdir` exists in the workspace. If not, create it. (This implies creating `handoff_archive_dir` if it doesn't exist).
            iv.  Define `archive_file_path = handoff_notes_archive_subdir + "handoff_notes_" + current_session_date_time + ".md"`.
            v.   AI SHOULD: Create the new file `archive_file_path` in the workspace.
            vi.  AI SHOULD: Write `current_notes_content` into `archive_file_path`.
            vii. AI SHOULD: Modify `handoff_notes_path` in the workspace to make it empty.
            viii.INFO "Successfully archived current notes to " + `archive_file_path` + " and emptied " + `handoff_notes_path` + ". Ready for new session summary."
        g.  ELSE (if `handoff_notes_path` does not exist or is already empty):
            i.   INFO "`handoff_notes.md` is already empty or does not exist. No archival needed before appending new summary."
    1.  **Review `Framework_Full_Handoff_Notes_Enabled` (determined in Section I.I).**
    2.  **IF `Framework_Full_Handoff_Notes_Enabled` is `true`:**
        a.  At the end of your session, you MUST append a detailed session summary to `framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes.md` (which should now be empty following the archival in step IV.C.0). This summary should include:
            *   User feedback/requests you addressed.
            *   A detailed account of changes made to this framework's documents or other deliverables (e.g., `core_planning_instructions.txt`, `available_add_ons_manifest.md`, `compliance_plm_manifest.json`).
            *   The state in which deliverables were left (e.g., specific commits, branches).
            *   Any pending items or suggestions for the next Jules instance.
        b.  IMPORTANT: Ensure the 'Framework Performance Feedback Log' section within `handoff_notes.md` is NOT included or appended to in this file. Your new summary block should be appended after existing session summaries but before any 'Framework Performance Feedback Log' section if one accidentally exists. The goal is to phase out direct updates to that specific log section from this file.
    3.  **ELSE (if `Framework_Full_Handoff_Notes_Enabled` is `false`):**
        a.  At the end of your session, you MUST append a *concise* session summary to `framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes.md` (which should now be empty following the archival in step IV.C.0). This summary should focus *only* on:
            *   Major architectural changes implemented.
            *   Key decisions made that affect the framework's evolution.
            *   The final state of key deliverables (e.g., new components created, significant refactoring of core files like `core_planning_instructions.txt`).
        b.  Avoid detailed chronological accounts of your actions; aim for a high-level recap of critical developments.
        c.  IMPORTANT: Ensure the 'Framework Performance Feedback Log' section within `handoff_notes.md` is NOT included or appended to in this file. Your new summary block should be appended after existing session summaries but before any 'Framework Performance Feedback Log' section if one accidentally exists. The goal is to phase out direct updates to that specific log section from this file.
    4.  **General Note on Handoff Notes Archive:**
        a.  Be aware that a more detailed historical archive of handoff notes might exist at `framework_dev_docs/meta/handoff_notes_full_archive_20250602.md`.
        b.  You should NOT read this archive file unless you determine it is critical for understanding specific historical context to fulfill the current user request AND you explicitly ask for and receive user permission to do so. Your primary source for ongoing handoff information is the main `handoff_notes.md` file.

D. **Self-Correction and Learning:**
    *   Review all warnings and errors generated during this session.
    *   If a component's `user_..._config.txt` was updated due to AI-assisted parameter gathering, ensure this is noted.
    *   Reflect on any ambiguities in component instructions or the framework (`core_planning_instructions.txt`) itself.
    *   Consider if the handoff notes you just prepared (detailed or concise) accurately reflect the session's outcome and provide useful context for the next AI instance.
