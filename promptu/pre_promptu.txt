# === PRE-PROMPTU TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USER ===
#
# This file (`pre_promptu.txt`) is a template for configuring and running utilities
# *before* your main project request is processed by `post_promptu.txt`.
#
# 1. **COPY TO YOUR PROJECT (if not already there):**
#    Ensure this file (or a copy you configure) is in your project's
#    `promptu/` directory (e.g., `my_project_repo/promptu/pre_promptu.txt`).
#
# 2. **CONFIGURE YOUR `pre_promptu.txt` FILE:**
#    Edit the user configuration blocks within this file as needed:
#    *   `[[USER_UTIL_SELECTION]]`: Select utilities to run.
#    *   `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_utilityName]]`: Provide specific configurations for
#       any selected utilities that require them.
#
# 3. **INVOKE THE PRE-PROMPTU FRAMEWORK (YOUR ACTUAL PROMPT TO THE AI SYSTEM):**
#    Your actual prompt to the AI planning system for these pre-processing utilities
#    will be a single directive pointing to THIS prepared file. For example:
#
#    `[[PROCESS_FRAMEWORK_INSTRUCTIONS FROM /promptu/pre_promptu.txt]]`
#
#    The AI system will load this file and process your utility selections and configurations.

[[USER_UTIL_SELECTION]]
# Instructions for user:
# - List desired utility "app names" (folder names or direct .txt filenames) below, one per line.
# - Mark selection with '[x]' (case-insensitive for 'x').
# - Utilities must exist in `promptu/util/` in the target repository, either as
#   `promptu/util/utility_name.txt` or `promptu/util/utility_name/utility_name.txt`.
# - If a utility requires specific configuration, ensure you provide a corresponding
#   `[[USER_CONFIG_FOR_utilityName]]` block later in this file.

# Example:
# [x] promptimizer  # Assuming promptimizer is a utility available in promptu/util/
# [ ] another_utility
[[END_USER_UTIL_SELECTION]]

# Example of a utility-specific configuration block:
# [[USER_CONFIG_FOR_promptimizer]]
# # Add any parameters promptimizer might need here
# # Example_Param: Example_Value
# [[END_USER_CONFIG_FOR_promptimizer]]

# Overall AI Operation:
# You are a Planning AI. Your function is to process the selected utilities configured in this
# `pre_promptu.txt` file. These utilities are intended to run *before* the main
# user project request is processed (which is typically handled by `post_promptu.txt`).
# Core operational instructions, including component discovery and loading, are defined in an included file.

[[INCLUDE core_planning_instructions.txt FROM /promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt]]

# Note: The `core_planning_instructions.txt` will guide you on parsing `[[USER_UTIL_SELECTION]]`,
# discovering utility-specific config blocks, loading utility components, and executing them.
# It will need to be adapted to understand it's running in a "pre-promptu" context if its
# behavior needs to differ (e.g., not expecting a USER_PROJECT_REQUEST).
