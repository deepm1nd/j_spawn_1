[[START OF PRE-PROMPTU SEGMENT (v0.1.0)]]

# Overall AI Operation:
# You are a Planning AI. Your function is to process the selected utilities configured in this
# `pre_promptu.txt` file. These utilities are intended to run *before* the main
# user project request is processed (which is typically handled by `post_promptu.txt`).
# Core operational instructions, including component discovery and loading, are defined in an included file.

[[INCLUDE core_planning_instructions.txt FROM /promptu/core/core_planning_instructions.txt]]

# Note: The `core_planning_instructions.txt` will guide you on parsing `[[USER_UTIL_SELECTION]]`,
# discovering utility-specific config blocks, loading utility components, and executing them.
# It will need to be adapted to understand it's running in a "pre-promptu" context if its
# behavior needs to differ (e.g., not expecting a USER_PROJECT_REQUEST).
